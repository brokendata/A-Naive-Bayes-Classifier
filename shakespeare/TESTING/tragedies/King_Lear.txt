ACT ISCENE I. King Lear's palace.Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUNDKENTI thought the king had more affected the Duke ofAlbany than Cornwall.GLOUCESTERIt did always seem so to us: but now, in thedivision of the kingdom, it appears not which ofthe dukes he values most; for equalities are soweighed, that curiosity in neither can make choiceof either's moiety.KENTIs not this your son, my lord?GLOUCESTERHis breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I haveso often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I ambrazed to it.KENTI cannot conceive you.GLOUCESTERSir, this young fellow's mother could: whereuponshe grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a sonfor her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.Do you smell a fault?KENTI cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of itbeing so proper.GLOUCESTERBut I have, sir, a son by order of law, some yearelder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:though this knave came something saucily into theworld before he was sent for, yet was his motherfair; there was good sport at his making, and thewhoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know thisnoble gentleman, Edmund?EDMUNDNo, my lord.GLOUCESTERMy lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as myhonourable friend.EDMUNDMy services to your lordship.KENTI must love you, and sue to know you better.EDMUNDSir, I shall study deserving.GLOUCESTERHe hath been out nine years, and away he shallagain. The king is coming.Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and AttendantsKING LEARAttend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.GLOUCESTERI shall, my liege.Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUNDKING LEARMeantime we shall express our darker purpose.Give me the map there. Know that we have dividedIn three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intentTo shake all cares and business from our age;Conferring them on younger strengths, while weUnburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,And you, our no less loving son of Albany,We have this hour a constant will to publishOur daughters' several dowers, that future strifeMay be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--Since now we will divest us both of rule,Interest of territory, cares of state,--Which of you shall we say doth love us most?That we our largest bounty may extendWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,Our eldest-born, speak first.GONERILSir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;As much as child e'er loved, or father found;A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;Beyond all manner of so much I love you.CORDELIA[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?Love, and be silent.LEAROf all these bounds, even from this line to this,With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issueBe this perpetual. What says our second daughter,Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.REGANSir, I am madeOf the self-same metal that my sister is,And prize me at her worth. In my true heartI find she names my very deed of love;Only she comes too short: that I professMyself an enemy to all other joys,Which the most precious square of sense possesses;And find I am alone felicitateIn your dear highness' love.CORDELIA[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love'sMore richer than my tongue.KING LEARTo thee and thine hereditary everRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom;No less in space, validity, and pleasure,Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,Although the last, not least; to whose young loveThe vines of France and milk of BurgundyStrive to be interess'd; what can you say to drawA third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.CORDELIANothing, my lord.KING LEARNothing!CORDELIANothing.KING LEARNothing will come of nothing: speak again.CORDELIAUnhappy that I am, I cannot heaveMy heart into my mouth: I love your majestyAccording to my bond; nor more nor less.KING LEARHow, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,Lest it may mar your fortunes.CORDELIAGood my lord,You have begot me, bred me, loved me: IReturn those duties back as are right fit,Obey you, love you, and most honour you.Why have my sisters husbands, if they sayThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carryHalf my love with him, half my care and duty:Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,To love my father all.KING LEARBut goes thy heart with this?CORDELIAAy, good my lord.KING LEARSo young, and so untender?CORDELIASo young, my lord, and true.KING LEARLet it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;By all the operation of the orbsFrom whom we do exist, and cease to be;Here I disclaim all my paternal care,Propinquity and property of blood,And as a stranger to my heart and meHold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,Or he that makes his generation messesTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosomBe as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,As thou my sometime daughter.KENTGood my liege,--KING LEARPeace, Kent!Come not between the dragon and his wrath.I loved her most, and thought to set my restOn her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!So be my grave my peace, as here I giveHer father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.I do invest you jointly with my power,Pre-eminence, and all the large effectsThat troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,With reservation of an hundred knights,By you to be sustain'd, shall our abodeMake with you by due turns. Only we still retainThe name, and all the additions to a king;The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,This coronet part betwixt you.Giving the crownKENTRoyal Lear,Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--KING LEARThe bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.KENTLet it fall rather, though the fork invadeThe region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;And, in thy best consideration, chequeThis hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;Nor are those empty-hearted whose low soundReverbs no hollowness.KING LEARKent, on thy life, no more.KENTMy life I never held but as a pawnTo wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,Thy safety being the motive.KING LEAROut of my sight!KENTSee better, Lear; and let me still remainThe true blank of thine eye.KING LEARNow, by Apollo,--KENTNow, by Apollo, king,Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.KING LEARO, vassal! miscreant!Laying his hand on his swordALBANYCORNWALLDear sir, forbear.KENTDo:Kill thy physician, and the fee bestowUpon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,I'll tell thee thou dost evil.KING LEARHear me, recreant!On thine allegiance, hear me!Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd prideTo come between our sentence and our power,Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,Our potency made good, take thy reward.Five days we do allot thee, for provisionTo shield thee from diseases of the world;And on the sixth to turn thy hated backUpon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,This shall not be revoked.KENTFare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.To CORDELIAThe gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!To REGAN and GONERILAnd your large speeches may your deeds approve,That good effects may spring from words of love.Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;He'll shape his old course in a country new.ExitFlourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and AttendantsGLOUCESTERHere's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.KING LEARMy lord of Burgundy.We first address towards you, who with this kingHath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,Will you require in present dower with her,Or cease your quest of love?BURGUNDYMost royal majesty,I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,Nor will you tender less.KING LEARRight noble Burgundy,When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:If aught within that little seeming substance,Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,She's there, and she is yours.BURGUNDYI know no answer.KING LEARWill you, with those infirmities she owes,Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,Take her, or leave her?BURGUNDYPardon me, royal sir;Election makes not up on such conditions.KING LEARThen leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,I tell you all her wealth.To KING OF FRANCEFor you, great king,I would not from your love make such a stray,To match you where I hate; therefore beseech youTo avert your liking a more worthier wayThan on a wretch whom nature is ashamedAlmost to acknowledge hers.KING OF FRANCEThis is most strange,That she, that even but now was your best object,The argument of your praise, balm of your age,Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of timeCommit a thing so monstrous, to dismantleSo many folds of favour. Sure, her offenceMust be of such unnatural degree,That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affectionFall'n into taint: which to believe of her,Must be a faith that reason without miracleCould never plant in me.CORDELIAI yet beseech your majesty,--If for I want that glib and oily art,To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,I'll do't before I speak,--that you make knownIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;But even for want of that for which I am richer,A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongueAs I am glad I have not, though not to have itHath lost me in your liking.KING LEARBetter thouHadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.KING OF FRANCEIs it but this,--a tardiness in natureWhich often leaves the history unspokeThat it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,What say you to the lady? Love's not loveWhen it is mingled with regards that standAloof from the entire point. Will you have her?She is herself a dowry.BURGUNDYRoyal Lear,Give but that portion which yourself proposed,And here I take Cordelia by the hand,Duchess of Burgundy.KING LEARNothing: I have sworn; I am firm.BURGUNDYI am sorry, then, you have so lost a fatherThat you must lose a husband.CORDELIAPeace be with Burgundy!Since that respects of fortune are his love,I shall not be his wife.KING OF FRANCEFairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglectMy love should kindle to inflamed respect.Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:Not all the dukes of waterish BurgundyCan buy this unprized precious maid of me.Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:Thou losest here, a better where to find.KING LEARThou hast her, France: let her be thine; for weHave no such daughter, nor shall ever seeThat face of hers again. Therefore be goneWithout our grace, our love, our benison.Come, noble Burgundy.Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIAKING OF FRANCEBid farewell to your sisters.CORDELIAThe jewels of our father, with wash'd eyesCordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;And like a sister am most loath to callYour faults as they are named. Use well our father:To your professed bosoms I commit himBut yet, alas, stood I within his grace,I would prefer him to a better place.So, farewell to you both.REGANPrescribe not us our duties.GONERILLet your studyBe to content your lord, who hath received youAt fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,And well are worth the want that you have wanted.CORDELIATime shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.Well may you prosper!KING OF FRANCECome, my fair Cordelia.Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIAGONERILSister, it is not a little I have to say of whatmost nearly appertains to us both. I think ourfather will hence to-night.REGANThat's most certain, and with you; next month with us.GONERILYou see how full of changes his age is; theobservation we have made of it hath not beenlittle: he always loved our sister most; andwith what poor judgment he hath now cast her offappears too grossly.REGAN'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath everbut slenderly known himself.GONERILThe best and soundest of his time hath been butrash; then must we look to receive from his age,not alone the imperfections of long-engraffedcondition, but therewithal the unruly waywardnessthat infirm and choleric years bring with them.REGANSuch unconstant starts are we like to have fromhim as this of Kent's banishment.GONERILThere is further compliment of leavetakingbetween France and him. Pray you, let's hittogether: if our father carry authority withsuch dispositions as he bears, this lastsurrender of his will but offend us.REGANWe shall further think on't.GONERILWe must do something, and i' the heat.ExeuntSCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.Enter EDMUND, with a letterEDMUNDThou, nature, art my goddess; to thy lawMy services are bound. Wherefore should IStand in the plague of custom, and permitThe curiosity of nations to deprive me,For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shinesLag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?When my dimensions are as well compact,My mind as generous, and my shape as true,As honest madam's issue? Why brand they usWith base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, takeMore composition and fierce qualityThan doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:Our father's love is to the bastard EdmundAs to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,And my invention thrive, Edmund the baseShall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:Now, gods, stand up for bastards!Enter GLOUCESTERGLOUCESTERKent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!Confined to exhibition! All this doneUpon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?EDMUNDSo please your lordship, none.Putting up the letterGLOUCESTERWhy so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?EDMUNDI know no news, my lord.GLOUCESTERWhat paper were you reading?EDMUNDNothing, my lord.GLOUCESTERNo? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch ofit into your pocket? the quality of nothing hathnot such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.EDMUNDI beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letterfrom my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;and for so much as I have perused, I find it notfit for your o'er-looking.GLOUCESTERGive me the letter, sir.EDMUNDI shall offend, either to detain or give it. Thecontents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.GLOUCESTERLet's see, let's see.EDMUNDI hope, for my brother's justification, he wrotethis but as an essay or taste of my virtue.GLOUCESTER[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makesthe world bitter to the best of our times; keepsour fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relishthem. I begin to find an idle and fond bondagein the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, notas it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come tome, that of this I may speak more. If our fatherwould sleep till I waked him, you should half hisrevenue for ever, and live the beloved of yourbrother,	EDGAR.'Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--youshould enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brainto breed it in?--When came this to you? whobrought it?EDMUNDIt was not brought me, my lord; there's thecunning of it; I found it thrown in at thecasement of my closet.GLOUCESTERYou know the character to be your brother's?EDMUNDIf the matter were good, my lord, I durst swearit were his; but, in respect of that, I wouldfain think it were not.GLOUCESTERIt is his.EDMUNDIt is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart isnot in the contents.GLOUCESTERHath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?EDMUNDNever, my lord: but I have heard him oftmaintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,and fathers declining, the father should be asward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.GLOUCESTERO villain, villain! His very opinion in theletter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!Where is he?EDMUNDI do not well know, my lord. If it shall pleaseyou to suspend your indignation against mybrother till you can derive from him bettertestimony of his intent, you shall run a certaincourse; where, if you violently proceed againsthim, mistaking his purpose, it would make a greatgap in your own honour, and shake in pieces theheart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my lifefor him, that he hath wrote this to feel myaffection to your honour, and to no furtherpretence of danger.GLOUCESTERThink you so?EDMUNDIf your honour judge it meet, I will place youwhere you shall hear us confer of this, and by anauricular assurance have your satisfaction; andthat without any further delay than this very evening.GLOUCESTERHe cannot be such a monster--EDMUNDNor is not, sure.GLOUCESTERTo his father, that so tenderly and entirelyloves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek himout: wind me into him, I pray you: frame thebusiness after your own wisdom. I would unstatemyself, to be in a due resolution.EDMUNDI will seek him, sir, presently: convey thebusiness as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.GLOUCESTERThese late eclipses in the sun and moon portendno good to us: though the wisdom of nature canreason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itselfscourged by the sequent effects: love cools,friendship falls off, brothers divide: incities, mutinies; in countries, discord; inpalaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt sonand father. This villain of mine comes under theprediction; there's son against father: the kingfalls from bias of nature; there's father againstchild. We have seen the best of our time:machinations, hollowness, treachery, and allruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to ourgraves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shalllose thee nothing; do it carefully. And thenoble and true-hearted Kent banished! hisoffence, honesty! 'Tis strange.ExitEDMUNDThis is the excellent foppery of the world, that,when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeitof our own behavior,--we make guilty of ourdisasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: asif we were villains by necessity; fools byheavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, andtreachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience ofplanetary influence; and all that we are evil in,by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasionof whoremaster man, to lay his goatishdisposition to the charge of a star! Myfather compounded with my mother under thedragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursamajor; so that it follows, I am rough andlecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,had the maidenliest star in the firmamenttwinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--Enter EDGARAnd pat he comes like the catastrophe of the oldcomedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with asigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses doportend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.EDGARHow now, brother Edmund! what seriouscontemplation are you in?EDMUNDI am thinking, brother, of a prediction I readthis other day, what should follow these eclipses.EDGARDo you busy yourself about that?EDMUNDI promise you, the effects he writes of succeedunhappily; as of unnaturalness between the childand the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions ofancient amities; divisions in state, menaces andmaledictions against king and nobles; needlessdiffidences, banishment of friends, dissipationof cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.EDGARHow long have you been a sectary astronomical?EDMUNDCome, come; when saw you my father last?EDGARWhy, the night gone by.EDMUNDSpake you with him?EDGARAy, two hours together.EDMUNDParted you in good terms? Found you nodispleasure in him by word or countenance?EDGARNone at all.EDMUNDBethink yourself wherein you may have offendedhim: and at my entreaty forbear his presencetill some little time hath qualified the heat ofhis displeasure; which at this instant so ragethin him, that with the mischief of your person itwould scarcely allay.EDGARSome villain hath done me wrong.EDMUNDThat's my fear. I pray you, have a continentforbearance till the spied of his rage goesslower; and, as I say, retire with me to mylodging, from whence I will fitly bring you tohear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:if you do stir abroad, go armed.EDGARArmed, brother!EDMUNDBrother, I advise you to the best; go armed: Iam no honest man if there be any good meaningtowards you: I have told you what I have seenand heard; but faintly, nothing like the imageand horror of it: pray you, away.EDGARShall I hear from you anon?EDMUNDI do serve you in this business.Exit EDGARA credulous father! and a brother noble,Whose nature is so far from doing harms,That he suspects none: on whose foolish honestyMy practises ride easy! I see the business.Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.ExitSCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her stewardGONERILDid my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?OSWALDYes, madam.GONERILBy day and night he wrongs me; every hourHe flashes into one gross crime or other,That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids usOn every trifle. When he returns from hunting,I will not speak with him; say I am sick:If you come slack of former services,You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.OSWALDHe's coming, madam; I hear him.Horns withinGONERILPut on what weary negligence you please,You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:If he dislike it, let him to our sister,Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,That still would manage those authoritiesThat he hath given away! Now, by my life,Old fools are babes again; and must be usedWith cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.Remember what I tell you.OSWALDWell, madam.GONERILAnd let his knights have colder looks among you;What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.ExeuntSCENE IV. A hall in the same.Enter KENT, disguisedKENTIf but as well I other accents borrow,That can my speech defuse, my good intentMay carry through itself to that full issueFor which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,Shall find thee full of labours.Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and AttendantsKING LEARLet me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.Exit an AttendantHow now! what art thou?KENTA man, sir.KING LEARWhat dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?KENTI do profess to be no less than I seem; to servehim truly that will put me in trust: to love himthat is honest; to converse with him that is wise,and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when Icannot choose; and to eat no fish.KING LEARWhat art thou?KENTA very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.KING LEARIf thou be as poor for a subject as he is for aking, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?KENTService.KING LEARWho wouldst thou serve?KENTYou.KING LEARDost thou know me, fellow?KENTNo, sir; but you have that in your countenancewhich I would fain call master.KING LEARWhat's that?KENTAuthority.KING LEARWhat services canst thou do?KENTI can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curioustale in telling it, and deliver a plain messagebluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I amqualified in; and the best of me is diligence.KING LEARHow old art thou?KENTNot so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, norso old to dote on her for any thing: I have yearson my back forty eight.KING LEARFollow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee noworse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?Go you, and call my fool hither.Exit an AttendantEnter OSWALDYou, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?OSWALDSo please you,--ExitKING LEARWhat says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.Exit a KnightWhere's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.Re-enter KnightHow now! where's that mongrel?KnightHe says, my lord, your daughter is not well.KING LEARWhy came not the slave back to me when I called him.KnightSir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he wouldnot.KING LEARHe would not!KnightMy lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to myjudgment, your highness is not entertained with thatceremonious affection as you were wont; there's agreat abatement of kindness appears as well in thegeneral dependants as in the duke himself also andyour daughter.KING LEARHa! sayest thou so?KnightI beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;for my duty cannot be silent when I think yourhighness wronged.KING LEARThou but rememberest me of mine own conception: Ihave perceived a most faint neglect of late; which Ihave rather blamed as mine own jealous curiositythan as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:I will look further into't. But where's my fool? Ihave not seen him this two days.KnightSince my young lady's going into France, sir, thefool hath much pined away.KING LEARNo more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, andtell my daughter I would speak with her.Exit an AttendantGo you, call hither my fool.Exit an AttendantRe-enter OSWALDO, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,sir?OSWALDMy lady's father.KING LEAR'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: yourwhoreson dog! you slave! you cur!OSWALDI am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.KING LEARDo you bandy looks with me, you rascal?Striking himOSWALDI'll not be struck, my lord.KENTNor tripped neither, you base football player.Tripping up his heelsKING LEARI thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'lllove thee.KENTCome, sir, arise, away!

Can you make no use ofnothing, nuncle?KING LEARWhy, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.Fool[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent ofhis land comes to: he will not believe a fool.KING LEARA bitter fool!FoolDost thou know the difference, my boy, between abitter fool and a sweet fool?KING LEARNo, lad; teach me.FoolThat lord that counsell'd theeTo give away thy land,Come place him here by me,Do thou for him stand:The sweet and bitter foolWill presently appear;The one in motley here,The other found out there.KING LEARDost thou call me fool, boy?FoolAll thy other titles thou hast given away; thatthou wast born with.KENTThis is not altogether fool, my lord.FoolNo, faith, lords and great men will not let me; ifI had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:and ladies too, they will not let me have all foolto myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.KING LEARWhat two crowns shall they be?FoolWhy, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eatup the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thouclovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest awayboth parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'erthe dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speaklike myself in this, let him be whipped that firstfinds it so.SingingFools had ne'er less wit in a year;For wise men are grown foppish,They know not how their wits to wear,Their manners are so apish.KING LEARWhen were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?FoolI have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thydaughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest themthe rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,SingingThen they for sudden joy did weep,And I for sorrow sung,That such a king should play bo-peep,And go the fools among.Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teachthy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.KING LEARAn you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.FoolI marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lthave me whipped for lying; and sometimes I amwhipped for holding my peace. I had rather be anykind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not bethee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'the parings.Enter GONERILKING LEARHow now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.FoolThou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need tocare for her frowning; now thou art an O without afigure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,thou art nothing.To GONERILYes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your facebids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,He that keeps nor crust nor crum,Weary of all, shall want some.Pointing to KING LEARThat's a shealed peascod.GONERILNot only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,But other of your insolent retinueDo hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forthIn rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,I had thought, by making this well known unto you,To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,By what yourself too late have spoke and done.That you protect this course, and put it onBy your allowance; which if you should, the faultWould not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,Might in their working do you that offence,Which else were shame, that then necessityWill call discreet proceeding.FoolFor, you trow, nuncle,The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,That it's had it head bit off by it young.So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.KING LEARAre you our daughter?GONERILCome, sir,I would you would make use of that good wisdom,Whereof I know you are fraught; and put awayThese dispositions, that of late transform youFrom what you rightly are.FoolMay not an ass know when the cartdraws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.KING LEARDoth any here know me? This is not Lear:Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?Either his notion weakens, his discerningsAre lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.Who is it that can tell me who I am?FoolLear's shadow.KING LEARI would learn that; for, by themarks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,I should be false persuaded I had daughters.FoolWhich they will make an obedient father.KING LEARYour name, fair gentlewoman?GONERILThis admiration, sir, is much o' the savourOf other your new pranks. I do beseech youTo understand my purposes aright:As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,That this our court, infected with their manners,Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lustMake it more like a tavern or a brothelThan a graced palace. The shame itself doth speakFor instant remedy: be then desiredBy her, that else will take the thing she begs,A little to disquantity your train;And the remainder, that shall still depend,To be such men as may besort your age,And know themselves and you.KING LEARDarkness and devils!Saddle my horses; call my train together:Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.Yet have I left a daughter.GONERILYou strike my people; and your disorder'd rabbleMake servants of their betters.Enter ALBANYKING LEARWoe, that too late repents,--To ALBANYO, sir, are you come?Is it your will?

O most small fault,How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of natureFrom the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,Striking his headAnd thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.ALBANYMy lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorantOf what hath moved you.KING LEARIt may be so, my lord.Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intendTo make this creature fruitful!Into her womb convey sterility!Dry up in her the organs of increase;And from her derogate body never springA babe to honour her! If she must teem,Create her child of spleen; that it may live,And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;Turn all her mother's pains and benefitsTo laughter and contempt; that she may feelHow sharper than a serpent's tooth it isTo have a thankless child! Away, away!ExitALBANYNow, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?GONERILNever afflict yourself to know the cause;But let his disposition have that scopeThat dotage gives it.Re-enter KING LEARKING LEARWhat, fifty of my followers at a clap!Within a fortnight!ALBANYWhat's the matter, sir?KING LEARI'll tell thee:To GONERILLife and death! I am ashamedThat thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!The untented woundings of a father's cursePierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,And cast you, with the waters that you lose,To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:When she shall hear this of thee, with her nailsShe'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt findThat I'll resume the shape which thou dost thinkI have cast off for ever: thou shalt,I warrant thee.Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and AttendantsGONERILDo you mark that, my lord?ALBANYI cannot be so partial, Goneril,To the great love I bear you,--GONERILPray you, content.

Oswald, I say!ALBANYWell, you may fear too far.GONERILSafer than trust too far:Let me still take away the harms I fear,Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.What he hath utter'd I have writ my sisterIf she sustain him and his hundred knightsWhen I have show'd the unfitness,--Re-enter OSWALDHow now, Oswald!What, have you writ that letter to my sister?OSWALDYes, madam.GONERILTake you some company, and away to horse:Inform her full of my particular fear;And thereto add such reasons of your ownAs may compact it more. Get you gone;And hasten your return.Exit OSWALDNo, no, my lord,This milky gentleness and course of yoursThough I condemn not, yet, under pardon,You are much more attask'd for want of wisdomThan praised for harmful mildness.ALBANYHow far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.GONERILNay, then--ALBANYWell, well; the event.ExeuntSCENE V.

Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'the middle on's face?KING LEARNo.FoolWhy, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; thatwhat a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.KING LEARI did her wrong--FoolCanst tell how an oyster makes his shell?KING LEARNo.FoolNor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.KING LEARWhy?FoolWhy, to put his head in; not to give it away to hisdaughters, and leave his horns without a case.KING LEARI will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be myhorses ready?FoolThy asses are gone about 'em.

Beloved Regan,Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tiedSharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:Points to his heartI can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believeWith how depraved a quality--O Regan!REGANI pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.You less know how to value her desertThan she to scant her duty.KING LEARSay, how is that?REGANI cannot think my sister in the leastWould fail her obligation: if, sir, perchanceShe have restrain'd the riots of your followers,'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,As clears her from all blame.KING LEARMy curses on her!REGANO, sir, you are old.Nature in you stands on the very vergeOf her confine: you should be ruled and ledBy some discretion, that discerns your stateBetter than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,That to our sister you do make return;Say you have wrong'd her, sir.KING LEARAsk her forgiveness?Do you but mark how this becomes the house:'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;KneelingAge is unnecessary: on my knees I begThat you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'REGANGood sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:Return you to my sister.KING LEAR[Rising]  Never, Regan:She hath abated me of half my train;Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:All the stored vengeances of heaven fallOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,You taking airs, with lameness!CORNWALLFie, sir, fie!KING LEARYou nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flamesInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,To fall and blast her pride!REGANO the blest gods! so will you wish on me,When the rash mood is on.KING LEARNo, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:Thy tender-hefted nature shall not giveThee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thineDo comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in theeTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,And in conclusion to oppose the boltAgainst my coming in: thou better know'stThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,Wherein I thee endow'd.REGANGood sir, to the purpose.KING LEARWho put my man i' the stocks?Tucket withinCORNWALLWhat trumpet's that?REGANI know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,That she would soon be here.Enter OSWALDIs your lady come?KING LEARThis is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd prideDwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.Out, varlet, from my sight!CORNWALLWhat means your grace?KING LEARWho stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hopeThou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,Enter GONERILIf you do love old men, if your sweet swayAllow obedience, if yourselves are old,Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!To GONERILArt not ashamed to look upon this beard?O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?GONERILWhy not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?All's not offence that indiscretion findsAnd dotage terms so.KING LEARO sides, you are too tough;Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?CORNWALLI set him there, sir: but his own disordersDeserved much less advancement.KING LEARYou! did you?REGANI pray you, father, being weak, seem so.If, till the expiration of your month,You will return and sojourn with my sister,Dismissing half your train, come then to me:I am now from home, and out of that provisionWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.KING LEARReturn to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?No, rather I abjure all roofs, and chooseTo wage against the enmity o' the air;To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless tookOur youngest born, I could as well be broughtTo knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension begTo keep base life afoot. Return with her?Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpterTo this detested groom.Pointing at OSWALDGONERILAt your choice, sir.KING LEARI prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:We'll no more meet, no more see one another:But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,I and my hundred knights.REGANNot altogether so:I look'd not for you yet, nor am providedFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;For those that mingle reason with your passionMust be content to think you old, and so--But she knows what she does.KING LEARIs this well spoken?REGANI dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?Is it not well? What should you need of more?Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and dangerSpeak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,Should many people, under two commands,Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.GONERILWhy might not you, my lord, receive attendanceFrom those that she calls servants or from mine?REGANWhy not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,We could control them. If you will come to me,--For now I spy a danger,--I entreat youTo bring but five and twenty: to no moreWill I give place or notice.KING LEARI gave you all--REGANAnd in good time you gave it.KING LEARMade you my guardians, my depositaries;But kept a reservation to be follow'dWith such a number. What, must I come to youWith five and twenty, Regan? said you so?REGANAnd speak't again, my lord; no more with me.KING LEARThose wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,When others are more wicked: not being the worstStands in some rank of praise.To GONERILI'll go with thee:Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,And thou art twice her love.GONERILHear me, my lord;What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,To follow in a house where twice so manyHave a command to tend you?REGANWhat need one?KING LEARO, reason not the need: our basest beggarsAre in the poorest thing superfluous:Allow not nature more than nature needs,Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;If only to go warm were gorgeous,Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,As full of grief as age; wretched in both!If it be you that stir these daughters' heartsAgainst their father, fool me not so muchTo bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,And let not women's weapons, water-drops,Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,I will have such revenges on you both,That all the world shall--I will do such things,--What they are, yet I know not: but they shall beThe terrors of the earth. You think I'll weepNo, I'll not weep:I have full cause of weeping; but this heartShall break into a hundred thousand flaws,Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and FoolStorm and tempestCORNWALLLet us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.REGANThis house is little: the old man and his peopleCannot be well bestow'd.GONERIL'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,And must needs taste his folly.REGANFor his particular, I'll receive him gladly,But not one follower.GONERILSo am I purposed.Where is my lord of Gloucester?CORNWALLFollow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.Re-enter GLOUCESTERGLOUCESTERThe king is in high rage.CORNWALLWhither is he going?GLOUCESTERHe calls to horse; but will I know not whither.CORNWALL'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.GONERILMy lord, entreat him by no means to stay.GLOUCESTERAlack, the night comes on, and the bleak windsDo sorely ruffle; for many miles a boutThere's scarce a bush.REGANO, sir, to wilful men,The injuries that they themselves procureMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:He is attended with a desperate train;And what they may incense him to, being aptTo have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.CORNWALLShut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I.

There is division,Although as yet the face of it be cover'dWith mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;Who have--as who have not, that their great starsThroned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,Which are to France the spies and speculationsIntelligent of our state; what hath been seen,Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,Or the hard rein which both of them have borneAgainst the old kind king; or something deeper,Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;But, true it is, from France there comes a powerInto this scatter'd kingdom; who already,Wise in our negligence, have secret feetIn some of our best ports, and are at pointTo show their open banner. Now to you:If on my credit you dare build so farTo make your speed to Dover, you shall findSome that will thank you, making just reportOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrowThe king hath cause to plain.I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;And, from some knowledge and assurance, offerThis office to you.GentlemanI will talk further with you.KENTNo, do not.For confirmation that I am much moreThan my out-wall, open this purse, and takeWhat it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;And she will tell you who your fellow isThat yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!I will go seek the king.GentlemanGive me your hand: have you no more to say?KENTFew words, but, to effect, more than all yet;That, when we have found the king,--in which your painThat way, I'll this,--he that first lights on himHolla the other.Exeunt severallySCENE II.

There's a division betwixtthe dukes; and a worse matter than that: I havereceived a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to bespoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:these injuries the king now bears will be revengedhome; there's part of a power already footed: wemust incline to the king. I will seek him, andprivily relieve him: go you and maintain talk withthe duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:if he ask for me.

Let him first answer that.GLOUCESTERI am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.REGANWherefore to Dover, sir?GLOUCESTERBecause I would not see thy cruel nailsPluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sisterIn his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.The sea, with such a storm as his bare headIn hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,And quench'd the stelled fires:Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'All cruels else subscribed: but I shall seeThe winged vengeance overtake such children.CORNWALLSee't shalt thou never.

O dear son Edgar,The food of thy abused father's wrath!Might I but live to see thee in my touch,I'ld say I had eyes again!Old ManHow now! Who's there?EDGAR[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am atthe worst'?I am worse than e'er I was.Old Man'Tis poor mad Tom.EDGAR[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is notSo long as we can say  'This is the worst.'Old ManFellow, where goest?GLOUCESTERIs it a beggar-man?Old ManMadman and beggar too.GLOUCESTERHe has some reason, else he could not beg.I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;Which made me think a man a worm: my sonCame then into my mind; and yet my mindWas then scarce friends with him: I have heardmore since.As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.They kill us for their sport.EDGAR[Aside]	How should this be?Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!GLOUCESTERIs that the naked fellow?Old ManAy, my lord.GLOUCESTERThen, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;And bring some covering for this naked soul,Who I'll entreat to lead me.Old ManAlack, sir, he is mad.GLOUCESTER'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;Above the rest, be gone.Old ManI'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,Come on't what will.ExitGLOUCESTERSirrah, naked fellow,--EDGARPoor Tom's a-cold.AsideI cannot daub it further.GLOUCESTERCome hither, fellow.EDGAR[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.GLOUCESTERKnow'st thou the way to Dover?EDGARBoth stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path.

Before ALBANY's palace.Enter GONERIL and EDMUNDGONERILWelcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husbandNot met us on the way.Enter OSWALDNow, where's your master'?OSWALDMadam, within; but never man so changed.I told him of the army that was landed;He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,And of the loyal service of his son,When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;What like, offensive.GONERIL[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.It is the cowish terror of his spirit,That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongsWhich tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the wayMay prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:I must change arms at home, and give the distaffInto my husband's hands. This trusty servantShall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,If you dare venture in your own behalf,A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;Giving a favourDecline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:Conceive, and fare thee well.EDMUNDYours in the ranks of death.GONERILMy most dear Gloucester!Exit EDMUNDO, the difference of man and man!To thee a woman's services are due:My fool usurps my body.OSWALDMadam, here comes my lord.ExitEnter ALBANYGONERILI have been worth the whistle.ALBANYO Goneril!You are not worth the dust which the rude windBlows in your face. I fear your disposition:That nature, which contemns its origin,Cannot be border'd certain in itself;She that herself will sliver and disbranchFrom her material sap, perforce must witherAnd come to deadly use.GONERILNo more; the text is foolish.ALBANYWisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?A father, and a gracious aged man,Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.Could my good brother suffer you to do it?A man, a prince, by him so benefited!If that the heavens do not their visible spiritsSend quickly down to tame these vile offences,It will come,Humanity must perforce prey on itself,Like monsters of the deep.GONERILMilk-liver'd man!That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerningThine honour from thy suffering; that not know'stFools do those villains pity who are punish'dEre they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest'Alack, why does he so?'ALBANYSee thyself, devil!Proper deformity seems not in the fiendSo horrid as in woman.GONERILO vain fool!ALBANYThou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitnessTo let these hands obey my blood,They are apt enough to dislocate and tearThy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,A woman's shape doth shield thee.GONERILMarry, your manhood now--Enter a MessengerALBANYWhat news?MessengerO, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:Slain by his servant, going to put outThe other eye of Gloucester.ALBANYGloucester's eye!MessengerA servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,Opposed against the act, bending his swordTo his great master; who, thereat enraged,Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;But not without that harmful stroke, which sinceHath pluck'd him after.ALBANYThis shows you are above,You justicers, that these our nether crimesSo speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!Lost he his other eye?MessengerBoth, both, my lord.This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;'Tis from your sister.GONERIL[Aside]              One way I like this well;But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,May all the building in my fancy pluckUpon my hateful life: another way,The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.ExitALBANYWhere was his son when they did take his eyes?MessengerCome with my lady hither.ALBANYHe is not here.MessengerNo, my good lord; I met him back again.ALBANYKnows he the wickedness?MessengerAy, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;And quit the house on purpose, that their punishmentMight have the freer course.ALBANYGloucester, I liveTo thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,And to revenge thine eyes.

You have seenSunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tearsWere like a better way: those happy smilets,That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to knowWhat guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,If all could so become it.KENTMade she no verbal question?Gentleman'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?Let pity not be believed!' There she shookThe holy water from her heavenly eyes,And clamour moisten'd: then away she startedTo deal with grief alone.KENTIt is the stars,The stars above us, govern our conditions;Else one self mate and mate could not begetSuch different issues. You spoke not with her since?GentlemanNo.KENTWas this before the king return'd?GentlemanNo, since.KENTWell, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;Who sometime, in his better tune, remembersWhat we are come about, and by no meansWill yield to see his daughter.GentlemanWhy, good sir?KENTA sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd herTo foreign casualties, gave her dear rightsTo his dog-hearted daughters, these things stingHis mind so venomously, that burning shameDetains him from Cordelia.GentlemanAlack, poor gentleman!KENTOf Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?Gentleman'Tis so, they are afoot.KENTWell, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,And leave you to attend him: some dear causeWill in concealment wrap me up awhile;When I am known aright, you shall not grieveLending me this acquaintance. I pray you, goAlong with me.ExeuntSCENE IV. The same. A tent.Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and SoldiersCORDELIAAlack, 'tis he: why, he was met even nowAs mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,Darnel, and all the idle weeds that growIn our sustaining corn. A century send forth;Search every acre in the high-grown field,And bring him to our eye.Exit an OfficerWhat can man's wisdomIn the restoring his bereaved sense?He that helps him take all my outward worth.DoctorThere is means, madam:Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,Are many simples operative, whose powerWill close the eye of anguish.CORDELIAAll blest secrets,All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediateIn the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the lifeThat wants the means to lead it.Enter a MessengerMessengerNews, madam;The British powers are marching hitherward.CORDELIA'Tis known before; our preparation standsIn expectation of them. O dear father,It is thy business that I go about;Therefore great FranceMy mourning and important tears hath pitied.No blown ambition doth our arms incite,But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:Soon may I hear and see him!ExeuntSCENE V.

Might not youTransport her purposes by word? Belike,Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,Let me unseal the letter.OSWALDMadam, I had rather--REGANI know your lady does not love her husband;I am sure of that: and at her late being hereShe gave strange oeillades and most speaking looksTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.OSWALDI, madam?REGANI speak in understanding; you are; I know't:Therefore I do advise you, take this note:My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;And more convenient is he for my handThan for your lady's: you may gather more.If you do find him, pray you, give him this;And when your mistress hears thus much from you,I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.So, fare you well.If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.OSWALDWould I could meet him, madam! I should showWhat party I do follow.REGANFare thee well.ExeuntSCENE VI. Fields near Dover.Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasantGLOUCESTERWhen shall we come to the top of that same hill?EDGARYou do climb up it now: look, how we labour.GLOUCESTERMethinks the ground is even.EDGARHorrible steep.Hark, do you hear the sea?GLOUCESTERNo, truly.EDGARWhy, then, your other senses grow imperfectBy your eyes' anguish.GLOUCESTERSo may it be, indeed:Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'stIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.EDGARYou're much deceived: in nothing am I changedBut in my garments.GLOUCESTERMethinks you're better spoken.EDGARCome on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearfulAnd dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!The crows and choughs that wing the midway airShow scarce so gross as beetles: half way downHangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoyAlmost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sightTopple down headlong.GLOUCESTERSet me where you stand.EDGARGive me your hand: you are now within a footOf the extreme verge: for all beneath the moonWould I not leap upright.GLOUCESTERLet go my hand.Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewelWell worth a poor man's taking: fairies and godsProsper it with thee! Go thou farther off;Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.EDGARNow fare you well, good sir.GLOUCESTERWith all my heart.EDGARWhy I do trifle thus with his despairIs done to cure it.GLOUCESTER[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,Shake patiently my great affliction off:If I could bear it longer, and not fallTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,My snuff and loathed part of nature shouldBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!Now, fellow, fare thee well.He falls forwardEDGARGone, sir: farewell.And yet I know not how conceit may robThe treasury of life, when life itselfYields to the theft: had he been where he thought,By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.What are you, sir?GLOUCESTERAway, and let me die.EDGARHadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,So many fathom down precipitating,Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.Ten masts at each make not the altitudeWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell:Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.GLOUCESTERBut have I fall'n, or no?EDGARFrom the dread summit of this chalky bourn.Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so farCannot be seen or heard: do but look up.GLOUCESTERAlack, I have no eyes.Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,And frustrate his proud will.EDGARGive me your arm:Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.GLOUCESTERToo well, too well.EDGARThis is above all strangeness.Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was thatWhich parted from you?GLOUCESTERA poor unfortunate beggar.EDGARAs I stood here below, methought his eyesWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,Think that the clearest gods, who make them honoursOf men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.GLOUCESTERI do remember now: henceforth I'll bearAffliction till it do cry out itself'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,I took it for a man; often 'twould say'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.EDGARBear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowersThe safer sense will ne'er accommodateHis master thus.KING LEARNo, they cannot touch me for coining; I am theking himself.EDGARO thou side-piercing sight!KING LEARNature's above art in that respect. There's yourpress-money. That fellow handles his bow like acrow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toastedcheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll proveit on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, wellflown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!Give the word.EDGARSweet marjoram.KING LEARPass.GLOUCESTERI know that voice.KING LEARHa! Goneril, with a white beard! They flatteredme like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in mybeard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'too was no good divinity. When the rain came towet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; whenthe thunder would not peace at my bidding; there Ifound 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they arenot men o' their words: they told me I was everything; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.GLOUCESTERThe trick of that voice I do well remember:Is 't not the king?KING LEARAy, every inch a king:When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded flyDoes lecher in my sight.Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard sonWas kinder to his father than my daughtersGot 'tween the lawful sheets.To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.Behold yond simpering dame,Whose face between her forks presages snow;That minces virtue, and does shake the headTo hear of pleasure's name;The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 'tWith a more riotous appetite.Down from the waist they are Centaurs,Though women all above:But to the girdle do the gods inherit,Beneath is all the fiends';There's hell, there's darkness, there's thesulphurous pit,Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:there's money for thee.GLOUCESTERO, let me kiss that hand!KING LEARLet me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.GLOUCESTERO ruin'd piece of nature! This great worldShall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?KING LEARI remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squinyat me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll notlove. Read thou this challenge; mark but thepenning of it.GLOUCESTERWere all the letters suns, I could not see one.EDGARI would not take this from report; it is,And my heart breaks at it.KING LEARRead.GLOUCESTERWhat, with the case of eyes?KING LEARO, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in yourhead, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are ina heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see howthis world goes.GLOUCESTERI see it feelingly.KING LEARWhat, art mad? A man may see how this world goeswith no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yondjustice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, inthine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, whichis the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seena farmer's dog bark at a beggar?GLOUCESTERAy, sir.KING LEARAnd the creature run from the cur? There thoumightst behold the great image of authority: adog's obeyed in office.Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kindFor which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:Take that of me, my friend, who have the powerTo seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;And like a scurvy politician, seemTo see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.EDGARO, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!KING LEARIf thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.GLOUCESTERAlack, alack the day!KING LEARWhen we are born, we cry that we are comeTo this great stage of fools: this a good block;It were a delicate stratagem, to shoeA troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!Enter a Gentleman, with AttendantsGentlemanO, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,Your most dear daughter--KING LEARNo rescue? What, a prisoner? I am evenThe natural fool of fortune. Use me well;You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;I am cut to the brains.GentlemanYou shall have any thing.KING LEARNo seconds? all myself?Why, this would make a man a man of salt,To use his eyes for garden water-pots,Ay, and laying autumn's dust.GentlemanGood sir,--KING LEARI will die bravely, like a bridegroom.

Come, let's away to prison:We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laughAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor roguesTalk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;And take upon's the mystery of things,As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,That ebb and flow by the moon.EDMUNDTake them away.KING LEARUpon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,The gods themselves throw incense.

With him I sent the queen;My reason all the same; and they are readyTo-morrow, or at further space, to appearWhere you shall hold your session. At this timeWe sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursedBy those that feel their sharpness:The question of Cordelia and her fatherRequires a fitter place.ALBANYSir, by your patience,I hold you but a subject of this war,Not as a brother.REGANThat's as we list to grace him.Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,Ere you had spoke so far.
