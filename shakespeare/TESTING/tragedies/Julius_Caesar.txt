ACT ISCENE I. Rome. A street.Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain CommonersFLAVIUSHence! home, you idle creatures get you home:Is this a holiday? what! know you not,Being mechanical, you ought not walkUpon a labouring day without the signOf your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?First CommonerWhy, sir, a carpenter.MARULLUSWhere is thy leather apron and thy rule?What dost thou with thy best apparel on?You, sir, what trade are you?Second CommonerTruly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,as you would say, a cobbler.MARULLUSBut what trade art thou? answer me directly.Second CommonerA trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safeconscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.MARULLUSWhat trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?Second CommonerNay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,if you be out, sir, I can mend you.MARULLUSWhat meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!Second CommonerWhy, sir, cobble you.FLAVIUSThou art a cobbler, art thou?Second CommonerTruly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: Imeddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women'smatters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeonto old shoes; when they are in great danger, Irecover them. As proper men as ever trod uponneat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.FLAVIUSBut wherefore art not in thy shop today?Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?Second CommonerTruly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myselfinto more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.MARULLUSWherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?What tributaries follow him to Rome,To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oftHave you climb'd up to walls and battlements,To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,Your infants in your arms, and there have satThe livelong day, with patient expectation,To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:And when you saw his chariot but appear,Have you not made an universal shout,That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,To hear the replication of your soundsMade in her concave shores?And do you now put on your best attire?And do you now cull out a holiday?And do you now strew flowers in his wayThat comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,Pray to the gods to intermit the plagueThat needs must light on this ingratitude.FLAVIUSGo, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,Assemble all the poor men of your sort;Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tearsInto the channel, till the lowest streamDo kiss the most exalted shores of all.Exeunt all the CommonersSee whether their basest metal be not moved;They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.Go you down that way towards the Capitol;This way will Idisrobe the images,If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.MARULLUSMay we do so?You know it is the feast of Lupercal.FLAVIUSIt is no matter; let no imagesBe hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,And drive away the vulgar from the streets:So do you too, where you perceive them thick.These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wingWill make him fly an ordinary pitch,Who else would soar above the view of menAnd keep us all in servile fearfulness.ExeuntSCENE II. A public place.Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a SoothsayerCAESARCalpurnia!CASCAPeace, ho! Caesar speaks.CAESARCalpurnia!CALPURNIAHere, my lord.CAESARStand you directly in Antonius' way,When he doth run his course. Antonius!ANTONYCaesar, my lord?CAESARForget not, in your speed, Antonius,To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,The barren, touched in this holy chase,Shake off their sterile curse.ANTONYI shall remember:When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.CAESARSet on; and leave no ceremony out.FlourishSoothsayerCaesar!CAESARHa! who calls?CASCABid every noise be still: peace yet again!CAESARWho is it in the press that calls on me?I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.SoothsayerBeware the ides of March.CAESARWhat man is that?BRUTUSA soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.CAESARSet him before me; let me see his face.CASSIUSFellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.CAESARWhat say'st thou to me now? speak once again.SoothsayerBeware the ides of March.CAESARHe is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUSCASSIUSWill you go see the order of the course?BRUTUSNot I.CASSIUSI pray you, do.BRUTUSI am not gamesome: I do lack some partOf that quick spirit that is in Antony.Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;I'll leave you.CASSIUSBrutus, I do observe you now of late:I have not from your eyes that gentlenessAnd show of love as I was wont to have:You bear too stubborn and too strange a handOver your friend that loves you.BRUTUSCassius,Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,I turn the trouble of my countenanceMerely upon myself. Vexed I amOf late with passions of some difference,Conceptions only proper to myself,Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--Among which number, Cassius, be you one--Nor construe any further my neglect,Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,Forgets the shows of love to other men.CASSIUSThen, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;By means whereof this breast of mine hath buriedThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?BRUTUSNo, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,But by reflection, by some other things.CASSIUS'Tis just:And it is very much lamented, Brutus,That you have no such mirrors as will turnYour hidden worthiness into your eye,That you might see your shadow. I have heard,Where many of the best respect in Rome,Except immortal Caesar, speaking of BrutusAnd groaning underneath this age's yoke,Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.BRUTUSInto what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,That you would have me seek into myselfFor that which is not in me?CASSIUSTherefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:And since you know you cannot see yourselfSo well as by reflection, I, your glass,Will modestly discover to yourselfThat of yourself which you yet know not of.And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:Were I a common laugher, or did useTo stale with ordinary oaths my loveTo every new protester; if you knowThat I do fawn on men and hug them hardAnd after scandal them, or if you knowThat I profess myself in banquetingTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.Flourish, and shoutBRUTUSWhat means this shouting? I do fear, the peopleChoose Caesar for their king.CASSIUSAy, do you fear it?Then must I think you would not have it so.BRUTUSI would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.But wherefore do you hold me here so long?What is it that you would impart to me?If it be aught toward the general good,Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,And I will look on both indifferently,For let the gods so speed me as I loveThe name of honour more than I fear death.CASSIUSI know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,As well as I do know your outward favour.Well, honour is the subject of my story.I cannot tell what you and other menThink of this life; but, for my single self,I had as lief not be as live to beIn awe of such a thing as I myself.I was born free as Caesar; so were you:We both have fed as well, and we can bothEndure the winter's cold as well as he:For once, upon a raw and gusty day,The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, nowLeap in with me into this angry flood,And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,Accoutred as I was, I plunged inAnd bade him follow; so indeed he did.The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet itWith lusty sinews, throwing it asideAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy;But ere we could arrive the point proposed,Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulderThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of TiberDid I the tired Caesar. And this manIs now become a god, and Cassius isA wretched creature and must bend his body,If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.He had a fever when he was in Spain,And when the fit was on him, I did markHow he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;His coward lips did from their colour fly,And that same eye whose bend doth awe the worldDid lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the RomansMark him and write his speeches in their books,Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze meA man of such a feeble temper shouldSo get the start of the majestic worldAnd bear the palm alone.Shout. FlourishBRUTUSAnother general shout!I do believe that these applauses areFor some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.CASSIUSWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow worldLike a Colossus, and we petty menWalk under his huge legs and peep aboutTo find ourselves dishonourable graves.Men at some time are masters of their fates:The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,But in ourselves, that we are underlings.Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?Why should that name be sounded more than yours?Write them together, yours is as fair a name;Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.Now, in the names of all the gods at once,Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!When went there by an age, since the great flood,But it was famed with more than with one man?When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,When there is in it but one only man.O, you and I have heard our fathers say,There was a Brutus once that would have brook'dThe eternal devil to keep his state in RomeAs easily as a king.BRUTUSThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous;What you would work me to, I have some aim:How I have thought of this and of these times,I shall recount hereafter; for this present,I would not, so with love I might entreat you,Be any further moved. What you have saidI will consider; what you have to sayI will with patience hear, and find a timeBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:Brutus had rather be a villagerThan to repute himself a son of RomeUnder these hard conditions as this timeIs like to lay upon us.CASSIUSI am glad that my weak wordsHave struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.BRUTUSThe games are done and Caesar is returning.CASSIUSAs they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;And he will, after his sour fashion, tell youWhat hath proceeded worthy note to-day.Re-enter CAESAR and his TrainBRUTUSI will do so. But, look you, Cassius,The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,And all the rest look like a chidden train:Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and CiceroLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyesAs we have seen him in the Capitol,Being cross'd in conference by some senators.CASSIUSCasca will tell us what the matter is.CAESARAntonius!ANTONYCaesar?CAESARLet me have men about me that are fat;Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.ANTONYFear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;He is a noble Roman and well given.CAESARWould he were fatter! But I fear him not:Yet if my name were liable to fear,I do not know the man I should avoidSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;He is a great observer and he looksQuite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sortAs if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spiritThat could be moved to smile at any thing.Such men as he be never at heart's easeWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,And therefore are they very dangerous.I rather tell thee what is to be fear'dThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCACASCAYou pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?BRUTUSAy, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,That Caesar looks so sad.CASCAWhy, you were with him, were you not?BRUTUSI should not then ask Casca what had chanced.CASCAWhy, there was a crown offered him: and beingoffered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.BRUTUSWhat was the second noise for?CASCAWhy, for that too.CASSIUSThey shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?CASCAWhy, for that too.BRUTUSWas the crown offered him thrice?CASCAAy, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, everytime gentler than other, and at every putting-bymine honest neighbours shouted.CASSIUSWho offered him the crown?CASCAWhy, Antony.BRUTUSTell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.CASCAI can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw MarkAntony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crownneither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I toldyou, he put it by once: but, for all that, to mythinking, he would fain have had it. Then heoffered it to him again; then he put it by again:but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay hisfingers off it. And then he offered it the thirdtime; he put it the third time by: and still as herefused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped theirchapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-capsand uttered such a deal of stinking breath becauseCaesar refused the crown that it had almost chokedCaesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: andfor mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear ofopening my lips and receiving the bad air.CASSIUSBut, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?CASCAHe fell down in the market-place, and foamed atmouth, and was speechless.BRUTUS'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.CASSIUSNo, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.CASCAI know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did notclap him and hiss him, according as he pleased anddispleased them, as they use to do the players inthe theatre, I am no true man.BRUTUSWhat said he when he came unto himself?CASCAMarry, before he fell down, when he perceived thecommon herd was glad he refused the crown, heplucked me ope his doublet and offered them histhroat to cut. An I had been a man of anyoccupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And sohe fell. When he came to himself again, he said,If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desiredtheir worships to think it was his infirmity. Threeor four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, goodsoul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: butthere's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar hadstabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.BRUTUSAnd after that, he came, thus sad, away?CASCAAy.CASSIUSDid Cicero say any thing?CASCAAy, he spoke Greek.CASSIUSTo what effect?CASCANay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' theface again: but those that understood him smiled atone another and shook their heads; but, for mine ownpart, it was Greek to me. I could tell you morenews too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfsoff Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare youwell. There was more foolery yet, if I couldremember it.CASSIUSWill you sup with me to-night, Casca?CASCANo, I am promised forth.CASSIUSWill you dine with me to-morrow?CASCAAy, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinnerworth the eating.CASSIUSGood: I will expect you.CASCADo so. Farewell, both.ExitBRUTUSWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be!He was quick mettle when he went to school.CASSIUSSo is he now in executionOf any bold or noble enterprise,However he puts on this tardy form.This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,Which gives men stomach to digest his wordsWith better appetite.BRUTUSAnd so it is. For this time I will leave you:To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,I will come home to you; or, if you will,Come home to me, and I will wait for you.CASSIUSI will do so: till then, think of the world.Exit BRUTUSWell, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,Thy honourable metal may be wroughtFrom that it is disposed: therefore it is meetThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;For who so firm that cannot be seduced?Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,He should not humour me. I will this night,In several hands, in at his windows throw,As if they came from several citizens,Writings all tending to the great opinionThat Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurelyCaesar's ambition shall be glanced at:And after this let Caesar seat him sure;For we will shake him, or worse days endure.ExitSCENE III. The same. A street.Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICEROCICEROGood even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?CASCAAre not you moved, when all the sway of earthShakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,I have seen tempests, when the scolding windsHave rived the knotty oaks, and I have seenThe ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,To be exalted with the threatening clouds:But never till to-night, never till now,Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.Either there is a civil strife in heaven,Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,Incenses them to send destruction.CICEROWhy, saw you any thing more wonderful?CASCAA common slave--you know him well by sight--Held up his left hand, which did flame and burnLike twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--Against the Capitol I met a lion,Who glared upon me, and went surly by,Without annoying me: and there were drawnUpon a heap a hundred ghastly women,Transformed with their fear; who swore they sawMen all in fire walk up and down the streets.And yesterday the bird of night did sitEven at noon-day upon the market-place,Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigiesDo so conjointly meet, let not men say'These are their reasons; they are natural;'For, I believe, they are portentous thingsUnto the climate that they point upon.CICEROIndeed, it is a strange-disposed time:But men may construe things after their fashion,Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?CASCAHe doth; for he did bid AntoniusSend word to you he would be there to-morrow.CICEROGood night then, Casca: this disturbed skyIs not to walk in.CASCAFarewell, Cicero.Exit CICEROEnter CASSIUSCASSIUSWho's there?CASCAA Roman.CASSIUSCasca, by your voice.CASCAYour ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!CASSIUSA very pleasing night to honest men.CASCAWho ever knew the heavens menace so?CASSIUSThose that have known the earth so full of faults.For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,Submitting me unto the perilous night,And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to openThe breast of heaven, I did present myselfEven in the aim and very flash of it.CASCABut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?It is the part of men to fear and tremble,When the most mighty gods by tokens sendSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.CASSIUSYou are dull, Casca, and those sparks of lifeThat should be in a Roman you do want,Or else you use not. You look pale and gazeAnd put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,To see the strange impatience of the heavens:But if you would consider the true causeWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,Why old men fool and children calculate,Why all these things change from their ordinanceTheir natures and preformed facultiesTo monstrous quality,--why, you shall findThat heaven hath infused them with these spirits,To make them instruments of fear and warningUnto some monstrous state.Now could I, Casca, name to thee a manMost like this dreadful night,That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roarsAs doth the lion in the Capitol,A man no mightier than thyself or meIn personal action, yet prodigious grownAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are.CASCA'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?CASSIUSLet it be who it is: for Romans nowHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors;But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.CASCAIndeed, they say the senators tomorrowMean to establish Caesar as a king;And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,In every place, save here in Italy.CASSIUSI know where I will wear this dagger then;Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;But life, being weary of these worldly bars,Never lacks power to dismiss itself.If I know this, know all the world besides,That part of tyranny that I do bearI can shake off at pleasure.Thunder stillCASCASo can I:So every bondman in his own hand bearsThe power to cancel his captivity.CASSIUSAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant then?Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.Those that with haste will make a mighty fireBegin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,What rubbish and what offal, when it servesFor the base matter to illuminateSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak thisBefore a willing bondman; then I knowMy answer must be made. But I am arm'd,And dangers are to me indifferent.CASCAYou speak to Casca, and to such a manThat is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:Be factious for redress of all these griefs,And I will set this foot of mine as farAs who goes farthest.CASSIUSThere's a bargain made.Now know you, Casca, I have moved alreadySome certain of the noblest-minded RomansTo undergo with me an enterpriseOf honourable-dangerous consequence;And I do know, by this, they stay for meIn Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,There is no stir or walking in the streets;And the complexion of the elementIn favour's like the work we have in hand,Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.CASCAStand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.CASSIUS'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;He is a friend.Enter CINNACinna, where haste you so?CINNATo find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?CASSIUSNo, it is Casca; one incorporateTo our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?CINNAI am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.CASSIUSAm I not stay'd for? tell me.CINNAYes, you are.O Cassius, if you couldBut win the noble Brutus to our party--CASSIUSBe you content: good Cinna, take this paper,And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,Where Brutus may but find it; and throw thisIn at his window; set this up with waxUpon old Brutus' statue: all this done,Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?CINNAAll but Metellus Cimber; and he's goneTo seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,And so bestow these papers as you bade me.CASSIUSThat done, repair to Pompey's theatre.Exit CINNACome, Casca, you and I will yet ere daySee Brutus at his house: three parts of himIs ours already, and the man entireUpon the next encounter yields him ours.CASCAO, he sits high in all the people's hearts:And that which would appear offence in us,His countenance, like richest alchemy,Will change to virtue and to worthiness.CASSIUSHim and his worth and our great need of himYou have right well conceited. Let us go,For it is after midnight; and ere dayWe will awake him and be sure of him.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.Enter BRUTUSBRUTUSWhat, Lucius, ho!I cannot, by the progress of the stars,Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!Enter LUCIUSLUCIUSCall'd you, my lord?BRUTUSGet me a taper in my study, Lucius:When it is lighted, come and call me here.LUCIUSI will, my lord.ExitBRUTUSIt must be by his death: and for my part,I know no personal cause to spurn at him,But for the general. He would be crown'd:How that might change his nature, there's the question.It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,That at his will he may do danger with.The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoinsRemorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,I have not known when his affections sway'dMore than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;But when he once attains the upmost round.He then unto the ladder turns his back,Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degreesBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may.Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrelWill bear no colour for the thing he is,Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,Would run to these and these extremities:And therefore think him as a serpent's eggWhich, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,And kill him in the shell.Re-enter LUCIUSLUCIUSThe taper burneth in your closet, sir.Searching the window for a flint, I foundThis paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,It did not lie there when I went to bed.Gives him the letterBRUTUSGet you to bed again; it is not day.Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?LUCIUSI know not, sir.BRUTUSLook in the calendar, and bring me word.LUCIUSI will, sir.ExitBRUTUSThe exhalations whizzing in the airGive so much light that I may read by them.Opens the letter and reads'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.Shall Rome,  & c. Speak, strike, redress!Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'Such instigations have been often dropp'dWhere I have took them up.'Shall Rome,  & c.' Thus must I piece it out:Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?My ancestors did from the streets of RomeThe Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreatedTo speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:If the redress will follow, thou receivestThy full petition at the hand of Brutus!Re-enter LUCIUSLUCIUSSir, March is wasted fourteen days.Knocking withinBRUTUS'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.Exit LUCIUSSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,I have not slept.Between the acting of a dreadful thingAnd the first motion, all the interim isLike a phantasma, or a hideous dream:The Genius and the mortal instrumentsAre then in council; and the state of man,Like to a little kingdom, suffers thenThe nature of an insurrection.Re-enter LUCIUSLUCIUSSir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,Who doth desire to see you.BRUTUSIs he alone?LUCIUSNo, sir, there are moe with him.BRUTUSDo you know them?LUCIUSNo, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,And half their faces buried in their cloaks,That by no means I may discover themBy any mark of favour.BRUTUSLet 'em enter.Exit LUCIUSThey are the faction. O conspiracy,Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,When evils are most free? O, then by dayWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enoughTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;Hide it in smiles and affability:For if thou path, thy native semblance on,Not Erebus itself were dim enoughTo hide thee from prevention.Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUSCASSIUSI think we are too bold upon your rest:Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?BRUTUSI have been up this hour, awake all night.Know I these men that come along with you?CASSIUSYes, every man of them, and no man hereBut honours you; and every one doth wishYou had but that opinion of yourselfWhich every noble Roman bears of you.This is Trebonius.BRUTUSHe is welcome hither.CASSIUSThis, Decius Brutus.BRUTUSHe is welcome too.CASSIUSThis, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.BRUTUSThey are all welcome.What watchful cares do interpose themselvesBetwixt your eyes and night?CASSIUSShall I entreat a word?BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisperDECIUS BRUTUSHere lies the east: doth not the day break here?CASCANo.CINNAO, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray linesThat fret the clouds are messengers of day.CASCAYou shall confess that you are both deceived.Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,Which is a great way growing on the south,Weighing the youthful season of the year.Some two months hence up higher toward the northHe first presents his fire; and the high eastStands, as the Capitol, directly here.BRUTUSGive me your hands all over, one by one.CASSIUSAnd let us swear our resolution.BRUTUSNo, not an oath: if not the face of men,The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--If these be motives weak, break off betimes,And every man hence to his idle bed;So let high-sighted tyranny range on,Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,As I am sure they do, bear fire enoughTo kindle cowards and to steel with valourThe melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,What need we any spur but our own cause,To prick us to redress? what other bondThan secret Romans, that have spoke the word,And will not palter? and what other oathThan honesty to honesty engaged,That this shall be, or we will fall for it?Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,Old feeble carrions and such suffering soulsThat welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swearSuch creatures as men doubt; but do not stainThe even virtue of our enterprise,Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,To think that or our cause or our performanceDid need an oath; when every drop of bloodThat every Roman bears, and nobly bears,Is guilty of a several bastardy,If he do break the smallest particleOf any promise that hath pass'd from him.CASSIUSBut what of Cicero? shall we sound him?I think he will stand very strong with us.CASCALet us not leave him out.CINNANo, by no means.METELLUS CIMBERO, let us have him, for his silver hairsWill purchase us a good opinionAnd buy men's voices to commend our deeds:It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,But all be buried in his gravity.BRUTUSO, name him not: let us not break with him;For he will never follow any thingThat other men begin.CASSIUSThen leave him out.CASCAIndeed he is not fit.DECIUS BRUTUSShall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?CASSIUSDecius, well urged: I think it is not meet,Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of himA shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,If he improve them, may well stretch so farAs to annoy us all: which to prevent,Let Antony and Caesar fall together.BRUTUSOur course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;And in the spirit of men there is no blood:O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,Stir up their servants to an act of rage,And after seem to chide 'em. This shall makeOur purpose necessary and not envious:Which so appearing to the common eyes,We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.And for Mark Antony, think not of him;For he can do no more than Caesar's armWhen Caesar's head is off.CASSIUSYet I fear him;For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--BRUTUSAlas, good Cassius, do not think of him:If he love Caesar, all that he can doIs to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:And that were much he should; for he is givenTo sports, to wildness and much company.TREBONIUSThere is no fear in him; let him not die;For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.Clock strikesBRUTUSPeace! count the clock.CASSIUSThe clock hath stricken three.TREBONIUS'Tis time to part.CASSIUSBut it is doubtful yet,Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;For he is superstitious grown of late,Quite from the main opinion he held onceOf fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:It may be, these apparent prodigies,The unaccustom'd terror of this night,And the persuasion of his augurers,May hold him from the Capitol to-day.DECIUS BRUTUSNever fear that: if he be so resolved,I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hearThat unicorns may be betray'd with trees,And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,Lions with toils and men with flatterers;But when I tell him he hates flatterers,He says he does, being then most flattered.Let me work;For I can give his humour the true bent,And I will bring him to the Capitol.CASSIUSNay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.BRUTUSBy the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?CINNABe that the uttermost, and fail not then.METELLUS CIMBERCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:I wonder none of you have thought of him.BRUTUSNow, good Metellus, go along by him:He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.CASSIUSThe morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all rememberWhat you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.BRUTUSGood gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;Let not our looks put on our purposes,But bear it as our Roman actors do,With untired spirits and formal constancy:And so good morrow to you every one.Exeunt all but BRUTUSBoy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,Which busy care draws in the brains of men;Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.Enter PORTIAPORTIABrutus, my lord!BRUTUSPortia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?It is not for your health thus to commitYour weak condition to the raw cold morning.PORTIANor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,Musing and sighing, with your arms across,And when I ask'd you what the matter was,You stared upon me with ungentle looks;I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,But, with an angry wafture of your hand,Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;Fearing to strengthen that impatienceWhich seem'd too much enkindled, and withalHoping it was but an effect of humour,Which sometime hath his hour with every man.It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,And could it work so much upon your shapeAs it hath much prevail'd on your condition,I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.BRUTUSI am not well in health, and that is all.PORTIABrutus is wise, and, were he not in health,He would embrace the means to come by it.BRUTUSWhy, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.PORTIAIs Brutus sick? and is it physicalTo walk unbraced and suck up the humoursOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,To dare the vile contagion of the nightAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurged airTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;You have some sick offence within your mind,Which, by the right and virtue of my place,I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,By all your vows of love and that great vowWhich did incorporate and make us one,That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,Why you are heavy, and what men to-nightHave had to resort to you: for here have beenSome six or seven, who did hide their facesEven from darkness.BRUTUSKneel not, gentle Portia.PORTIAI should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,Is it excepted I should know no secretsThat appertain to you? Am I yourselfBut, as it were, in sort or limitation,To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbsOf your good pleasure? If it be no more,Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.BRUTUSYou are my true and honourable wife,As dear to me as are the ruddy dropsThat visit my sad heartPORTIAIf this were true, then should I know this secret.I grant I am a woman; but withalA woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:I grant I am a woman; but withalA woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.Think you I am no stronger than my sex,Being so father'd and so husbanded?Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:I have made strong proof of my constancy,Giving myself a voluntary woundHere, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.And not my husband's secrets?BRUTUSO ye gods,Render me worthy of this noble wife!Knocking withinHark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;And by and by thy bosom shall partakeThe secrets of my heart.All my engagements I will construe to thee,All the charactery of my sad brows:Leave me with haste.Exit PORTIALucius, who's that knocks?Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUSLUCIUSHe is a sick man that would speak with you.BRUTUSCaius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?LIGARIUSVouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.BRUTUSO, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!LIGARIUSI am not sick, if Brutus have in handAny exploit worthy the name of honour.BRUTUSSuch an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.LIGARIUSBy all the gods that Romans bow before,I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!Brave son, derived from honourable loins!Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured upMy mortified spirit. Now bid me run,And I will strive with things impossible;Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?BRUTUSA piece of work that will make sick men whole.LIGARIUSBut are not some whole that we must make sick?BRUTUSThat must we also. What it is, my Caius,I shall unfold to thee, as we are goingTo whom it must be done.LIGARIUSSet on your foot,And with a heart new-fired I follow you,To do I know not what: but it sufficethThat Brutus leads me on.BRUTUSFollow me, then.ExeuntSCENE II. CAESAR's house.Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gownCAESARNor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?Enter a ServantServantMy lord?CAESARGo bid the priests do present sacrificeAnd bring me their opinions of success.ServantI will, my lord.ExitEnter CALPURNIACALPURNIAWhat mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?You shall not stir out of your house to-day.CAESARCaesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd meNe'er look'd but on my back; when they shall seeThe face of Caesar, they are vanished.CALPURNIACaesar, I never stood on ceremonies,Yet now they fright me. There is one within,Besides the things that we have heard and seen,Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.A lioness hath whelped in the streets;And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;The noise of battle hurtled in the air,Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,And I do fear them.CAESARWhat can be avoidedWhose end is purposed by the mighty gods?Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictionsAre to the world in general as to Caesar.CALPURNIAWhen beggars die, there are no comets seen;The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.CAESARCowards die many times before their deaths;The valiant never taste of death but once.Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.It seems to me most strange that men should fear;Seeing that death, a necessary end,Will come when it will come.Re-enter ServantWhat say the augurers?ServantThey would not have you to stir forth to-day.Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,They could not find a heart within the beast.CAESARThe gods do this in shame of cowardice:Caesar should be a beast without a heart,If he should stay at home to-day for fear.No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full wellThat Caesar is more dangerous than he:We are two lions litter'd in one day,And I the elder and more terrible:And Caesar shall go forth.CALPURNIAAlas, my lord,Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.Do not go forth to-day: call it my fearThat keeps you in the house, and not your own.We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:And he shall say you are not well to-day:Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.CAESARMark Antony shall say I am not well,And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.Enter DECIUS BRUTUSHere's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.DECIUS BRUTUSCaesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:I come to fetch you to the senate-house.CAESARAnd you are come in very happy time,To bear my greeting to the senatorsAnd tell them that I will not come to-day:Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.CALPURNIASay he is sick.CAESARShall Caesar send a lie?Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.DECIUS BRUTUSMost mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.CAESARThe cause is in my will: I will not come;That is enough to satisfy the senate.But for your private satisfaction,Because I love you, I will let you know:Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,Did run pure blood: and many lusty RomansCame smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,And evils imminent; and on her kneeHath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.DECIUS BRUTUSThis dream is all amiss interpreted;It was a vision fair and fortunate:Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,In which so many smiling Romans bathed,Signifies that from you great Rome shall suckReviving blood, and that great men shall pressFor tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.CAESARAnd this way have you well expounded it.DECIUS BRUTUSI have, when you have heard what I can say:And know it now: the senate have concludedTo give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.If you shall send them word you will not come,Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mockApt to be render'd, for some one to say'Break up the senate till another time,When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear loveTo our proceeding bids me tell you this;And reason to my love is liable.CAESARHow foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!I am ashamed I did yield to them.Give me my robe, for I will go.Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNAAnd look where Publius is come to fetch me.PUBLIUSGood morrow, Caesar.CAESARWelcome, Publius.What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,Caesar was ne'er so much your enemyAs that same ague which hath made you lean.What is 't o'clock?BRUTUSCaesar, 'tis strucken eight.CAESARI thank you for your pains and courtesy.Enter ANTONYSee! Antony, that revels long o' nights,Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.ANTONYSo to most noble Caesar.CAESARBid them prepare within:I am to blame to be thus waited for.Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!I have an hour's talk in store for you;Remember that you call on me to-day:Be near me, that I may remember you.TREBONIUSCaesar, I will:Asideand so near will I be,That your best friends shall wish I had been further.CAESARGood friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;And we, like friends, will straightway go together.BRUTUS[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!ExeuntSCENE III. A street near the Capitol.Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paperARTEMIDORUS'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust notTrebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutusloves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.There is but one mind in all these men, and it isbent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,'ARTEMIDORUS.'Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,And as a suitor will I give him this.My heart laments that virtue cannot liveOut of the teeth of emulation.If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.ExitSCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.Enter PORTIA and LUCIUSPORTIAI prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:Why dost thou stay?LUCIUSTo know my errand, madam.PORTIAI would have had thee there, and here again,Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.O constancy, be strong upon my side,Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.How hard it is for women to keep counsel!Art thou here yet?LUCIUSMadam, what should I do?Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?And so return to you, and nothing else?PORTIAYes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,For he went sickly forth: and take good noteWhat Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.Hark, boy! what noise is that?LUCIUSI hear none, madam.PORTIAPrithee, listen well;I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,And the wind brings it from the Capitol.LUCIUSSooth, madam, I hear nothing.Enter the SoothsayerPORTIACome hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?SoothsayerAt mine own house, good lady.PORTIAWhat is't o'clock?SoothsayerAbout the ninth hour, lady.PORTIAIs Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?SoothsayerMadam, not yet: I go to take my stand,To see him pass on to the Capitol.PORTIAThou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?SoothsayerThat I have, lady: if it will please CaesarTo be so good to Caesar as to hear me,I shall beseech him to befriend himself.PORTIAWhy, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?SoothsayerNone that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:I'll get me to a place more void, and thereSpeak to great Caesar as he comes along.ExitPORTIAI must go in. Ay me, how weak a thingThe heart of woman is! O Brutus,The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suitThat Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;Say I am merry: come to me again,And bring me word what he doth say to thee.Exeunt severallyACT IIISCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,  TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS, PUBLIUS, and othersCAESAR[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.SoothsayerAy, Caesar; but not gone.ARTEMIDORUSHail, Caesar! read this schedule.DECIUS BRUTUSTrebonius doth desire you to o'erread,At your best leisure, this his humble suit.ARTEMIDORUSO Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suitThat touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.CAESARWhat touches us ourself shall be last served.ARTEMIDORUSDelay not, Caesar; read it instantly.CAESARWhat, is the fellow mad?PUBLIUSSirrah, give place.CASSIUSWhat, urge you your petitions in the street?Come to the Capitol.CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest followingPOPILIUSI wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.CASSIUSWhat enterprise, Popilius?POPILIUSFare you well.Advances to CAESARBRUTUSWhat said Popilius Lena?CASSIUSHe wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.I fear our purpose is discovered.BRUTUSLook, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.CASSIUSCasca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,For I will slay myself.BRUTUSCassius, be constant:Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.CASSIUSTrebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.He draws Mark Antony out of the way.Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUSDECIUS BRUTUSWhere is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.BRUTUSHe is address'd: press near and second him.CINNACasca, you are the first that rears your hand.CAESARAre we all ready? What is now amissThat Caesar and his senate must redress?METELLUS CIMBERMost high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,Metellus Cimber throws before thy seatAn humble heart,--KneelingCAESARI must prevent thee, Cimber.These couchings and these lowly courtesiesMight fire the blood of ordinary men,And turn pre-ordinance and first decreeInto the law of children. Be not fond,To think that Caesar bears such rebel bloodThat will be thaw'd from the true qualityWith that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.Thy brother by decree is banished:If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without causeWill he be satisfied.METELLUS CIMBERIs there no voice more worthy than my ownTo sound more sweetly in great Caesar's earFor the repealing of my banish'd brother?BRUTUSI kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;Desiring thee that Publius Cimber mayHave an immediate freedom of repeal.CAESARWhat, Brutus!CASSIUSPardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.CASSIUSI could be well moved, if I were as you:If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:But I am constant as the northern star,Of whose true-fix'd and resting qualityThere is no fellow in the firmament.The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,They are all fire and every one doth shine,But there's but one in all doth hold his place:So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;Yet in the number I do know but oneThat unassailable holds on his rank,Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,Let me a little show it, even in this;That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,And constant do remain to keep him so.CINNAO Caesar,--CAESARHence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?DECIUS BRUTUSGreat Caesar,--CAESARDoth not Brutus bootless kneel?CASCASpeak, hands for me!CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESARCAESAREt tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.DiesCINNALiberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.CASSIUSSome to the common pulpits, and cry out'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'BRUTUSPeople and senators, be not affrighted;Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.CASCAGo to the pulpit, Brutus.DECIUS BRUTUSAnd Cassius too.BRUTUSWhere's Publius?CINNAHere, quite confounded with this mutiny.METELLUS CIMBERStand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar'sShould chance--BRUTUSTalk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;There is no harm intended to your person,Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.CASSIUSAnd leave us, Publius; lest that the people,Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.BRUTUSDo so: and let no man abide this deed,But we the doers.Re-enter TREBONIUSCASSIUSWhere is Antony?TREBONIUSFled to his house amazed:Men, wives and children stare, cry out and runAs it were doomsday.BRUTUSFates, we will know your pleasures:That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the timeAnd drawing days out, that men stand upon.CASSIUSWhy, he that cuts off twenty years of lifeCuts off so many years of fearing death.BRUTUSGrant that, and then is death a benefit:So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridgedHis time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's bloodUp to the elbows, and besmear our swords:Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'CASSIUSStoop, then, and wash. How many ages henceShall this our lofty scene be acted overIn states unborn and accents yet unknown!BRUTUSHow many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,That now on Pompey's basis lies alongNo worthier than the dust!CASSIUSSo oft as that shall be,So often shall the knot of us be call'dThe men that gave their country liberty.DECIUS BRUTUSWhat, shall we forth?CASSIUSAy, every man away:Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heelsWith the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.Enter a ServantBRUTUSSoft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.ServantThus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.If Brutus will vouchsafe that AntonyMay safely come to him, and be resolvedHow Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,Mark Antony shall not love Caesar deadSo well as Brutus living; but will followThe fortunes and affairs of noble BrutusThorough the hazards of this untrod stateWith all true faith. So says my master Antony.BRUTUSThy master is a wise and valiant Roman;I never thought him worse.Tell him, so please him come unto this place,He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,Depart untouch'd.ServantI'll fetch him presently.ExitBRUTUSI know that we shall have him well to friend.CASSIUSI wish we may: but yet have I a mindThat fears him much; and my misgiving stillFalls shrewdly to the purpose.BRUTUSBut here comes Antony.Re-enter ANTONYWelcome, Mark Antony.ANTONYO mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:If I myself, there is no hour so fitAs Caesar's death hour, nor no instrumentOf half that worth as those your swords, made richWith the most noble blood of all this world.I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,I shall not find myself so apt to die:No place will please me so, no mean of death,As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,The choice and master spirits of this age.BRUTUSO Antony, beg not your death of us.Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,As, by our hands and this our present act,You see we do, yet see you but our handsAnd this the bleeding business they have done:Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;And pity to the general wrong of Rome--As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:Our arms, in strength of malice, and our heartsOf brothers' temper, do receive you inWith all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.CASSIUSYour voice shall be as strong as any man'sIn the disposing of new dignities.BRUTUSOnly be patient till we have appeasedThe multitude, beside themselves with fear,And then we will deliver you the cause,Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,Have thus proceeded.ANTONYI doubt not of your wisdom.Let each man render me his bloody hand:First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?My credit now stands on such slippery ground,That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,Either a coward or a flatterer.That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:If then thy spirit look upon us now,Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,It would become me better than to closeIn terms of friendship with thine enemies.Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.How like a deer, strucken by many princes,Dost thou here lie!CASSIUSMark Antony,--ANTONYPardon me, Caius Cassius:The enemies of Caesar shall say this;Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.CASSIUSI blame you not for praising Caesar so;But what compact mean you to have with us?Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;Or shall we on, and not depend on you?ANTONYTherefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.Friends am I with you all and love you all,Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasonsWhy and wherein Caesar was dangerous.BRUTUSOr else were this a savage spectacle:Our reasons are so full of good regardThat were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,You should be satisfied.ANTONYThat's all I seek:And am moreover suitor that I mayProduce his body to the market-place;And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,Speak in the order of his funeral.BRUTUSYou shall, Mark Antony.CASSIUSBrutus, a word with you.Aside to BRUTUSYou know not what you do: do not consentThat Antony speak in his funeral:Know you how much the people may be movedBy that which he will utter?BRUTUSBy your pardon;I will myself into the pulpit first,And show the reason of our Caesar's death:What Antony shall speak, I will protestHe speaks by leave and by permission,And that we are contented Caesar shallHave all true rites and lawful ceremonies.It shall advantage more than do us wrong.CASSIUSI know not what may fall; I like it not.BRUTUSMark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,And say you do't by our permission;Else shall you not have any hand at allAbout his funeral: and you shall speakIn the same pulpit whereto I am going,After my speech is ended.ANTONYBe it so.I do desire no more.BRUTUSPrepare the body then, and follow us.Exeunt all but ANTONYANTONYO, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!Thou art the ruins of the noblest manThat ever lived in the tide of times.Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;Domestic fury and fierce civil strifeShall cumber all the parts of Italy;Blood and destruction shall be so in useAnd dreadful objects so familiarThat mothers shall but smile when they beholdTheir infants quarter'd with the hands of war;All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,With Ate by his side come hot from hell,Shall in these confines with a monarch's voiceCry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;That this foul deed shall smell above the earthWith carrion men, groaning for burial.Enter a ServantYou serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?ServantI do, Mark Antony.ANTONYCaesar did write for him to come to Rome.ServantHe did receive his letters, and is coming;And bid me say to you by word of mouth--O Caesar!--Seeing the bodyANTONYThy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,Began to water. Is thy master coming?ServantHe lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.ANTONYPost back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corseInto the market-place: there shall I tryIn my oration, how the people takeThe cruel issue of these bloody men;According to the which, thou shalt discourseTo young Octavius of the state of things.Lend me your hand.Exeunt with CAESAR's bodySCENE II. The Forum.Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of CitizensCitizensWe will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.BRUTUSThen follow me, and give me audience, friends.Cassius, go you into the other street,And part the numbers.Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;And public reasons shall be renderedOf Caesar's death.First CitizenI will hear Brutus speak.Second CitizenI will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,When severally we hear them rendered.Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpitThird CitizenThe noble Brutus is ascended: silence!BRUTUSBe patient till the last.Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for mycause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe mefor mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, thatyou may believe: censure me in your wisdom, andawake your senses, that you may the better judge.If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend ofCaesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesarwas no less than his. If then that friend demandwhy Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I lovedRome more. Had you rather Caesar were living anddie all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to liveall free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he wasvaliant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, Islew him. There is tears for his love; joy for hisfortune; honour for his valour; and death for hisambition. Who is here so base that would be abondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? Ifany, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here sovile that will not love his country? If any, speak;for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.AllNone, Brutus, none.BRUTUSThen none have I offended. I have done no more toCaesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question ofhis death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory notextenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offencesenforced, for which he suffered death.Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's bodyHere comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,though he had no hand in his death, shall receivethe benefit of his dying, a place in thecommonwealth; as which of you shall not? With thisI depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for thegood of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,when it shall please my country to need my death.AllLive, Brutus! live, live!First CitizenBring him with triumph home unto his house.Second CitizenGive him a statue with his ancestors.Third CitizenLet him be Caesar.Fourth CitizenCaesar's better partsShall be crown'd in Brutus.First CitizenWe'll bring him to his houseWith shouts and clamours.BRUTUSMy countrymen,--Second CitizenPeace, silence! Brutus speaks.First CitizenPeace, ho!BRUTUSGood countrymen, let me depart alone,And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speechTending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,By our permission, is allow'd to make.I do entreat you, not a man depart,Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.ExitFirst CitizenStay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.Third CitizenLet him go up into the public chair;We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.ANTONYFor Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.Goes into the pulpitFourth CitizenWhat does he say of Brutus?Third CitizenHe says, for Brutus' sake,He finds himself beholding to us all.Fourth Citizen'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.First CitizenThis Caesar was a tyrant.Third CitizenNay, that's certain:We are blest that Rome is rid of him.Second CitizenPeace! let us hear what Antony can say.ANTONYYou gentle Romans,--CitizensPeace, ho! let us hear him.ANTONYFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with Caesar. The noble BrutusHath told you Caesar was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--For Brutus is an honourable man;So are they all, all honourable men--Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:But Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.He hath brought many captives home to RomeWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crown,Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And, sure, he is an honourable man.I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know.You all did love him once, not without cause:What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,And I must pause till it come back to me.First CitizenMethinks there is much reason in his sayings.Second CitizenIf thou consider rightly of the matter,Caesar has had great wrong.Third CitizenHas he, masters?I fear there will a worse come in his place.Fourth CitizenMark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.First CitizenIf it be found so, some will dear abide it.Second CitizenPoor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.Third CitizenThere's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.Fourth CitizenNow mark him, he begins again to speak.ANTONYBut yesterday the word of Caesar mightHave stood against the world; now lies he there.And none so poor to do him reverence.O masters, if I were disposed to stirYour hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,Who, you all know, are honourable men:I will not do them wrong; I rather chooseTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,Than I will wrong such honourable men.But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:Let but the commons hear this testament--Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's woundsAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood,Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,And, dying, mention it within their wills,Bequeathing it as a rich legacyUnto their issue.Fourth CitizenWe'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.AllThe will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.ANTONYHave patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,It will inflame you, it will make you mad:'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;For, if you should, O, what would come of it!Fourth CitizenRead the will; we'll hear it, Antony;You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.ANTONYWill you be patient? will you stay awhile?I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:I fear I wrong the honourable menWhose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.Fourth CitizenThey were traitors: honourable men!AllThe will! the testament!Second CitizenThey were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.ANTONYYou will compel me, then, to read the will?Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,And let me show you him that made the will.Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?Several CitizensCome down.Second CitizenDescend.Third CitizenYou shall have leave.ANTONY comes downFourth CitizenA ring; stand round.First CitizenStand from the hearse, stand from the body.Second CitizenRoom for Antony, most noble Antony.ANTONYNay, press not so upon me; stand far off.Several CitizensStand back; room; bear back.ANTONYIf you have tears, prepare to shed them now.You all do know this mantle: I rememberThe first time ever Caesar put it on;'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,That day he overcame the Nervii:Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:See what a rent the envious Casca made:Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,As rushing out of doors, to be resolvedIf Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!This was the most unkindest cut of all;For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;And, in his mantle muffling up his face,Even at the base of Pompey's statua,Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feelThe dint of pity: these are gracious drops.Kind souls, what, weep you when you but beholdOur Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.First CitizenO piteous spectacle!Second CitizenO noble Caesar!Third CitizenO woful day!Fourth CitizenO traitors, villains!First CitizenO most bloody sight!Second CitizenWe will be revenged.AllRevenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!Let not a traitor live!ANTONYStay, countrymen.First CitizenPeace there! hear the noble Antony.Second CitizenWe'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.ANTONYGood friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you upTo such a sudden flood of mutiny.They that have done this deed are honourable:What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:I am no orator, as Brutus is;But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,That love my friend; and that they know full wellThat gave me public leave to speak of him:For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;I tell you that which you yourselves do know;Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,And Brutus Antony, there were an AntonyWould ruffle up your spirits and put a tongueIn every wound of Caesar that should moveThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.AllWe'll mutiny.First CitizenWe'll burn the house of Brutus.Third CitizenAway, then! come, seek the conspirators.ANTONYYet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.AllPeace, ho!

The will! Let's stay and hear the will.ANTONYHere is the will, and under Caesar's seal.To every Roman citizen he gives,To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.Second CitizenMost noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.Third CitizenO royal Caesar!ANTONYHear me with patience.AllPeace, ho!ANTONYMoreover, he hath left you all his walks,His private arbours and new-planted orchards,On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?First CitizenNever, never.

And now, Octavius,Listen great things:--Brutus and CassiusAre levying powers: we must straight make head:Therefore let our alliance be combined,Our best friends made, our means stretch'dAnd let us presently go sit in council,How covert matters may be best disclosed,And open perils surest answered.OCTAVIUSLet us do so: for we are at the stake,And bay'd about with many enemies;And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,Millions of mischiefs.ExeuntSCENE II.

Your master, Pindarus,In his own change, or by ill officers,Hath given me some worthy cause to wishThings done, undone: but, if he be at hand,I shall be satisfied.PINDARUSI do not doubtBut that my noble master will appearSuch as he is, full of regard and honour.BRUTUSHe is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;How he received you, let me be resolved.LUCILIUSWith courtesy and with respect enough;But not with such familiar instances,Nor with such free and friendly conference,As he hath used of old.BRUTUSThou hast describedA hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,When love begins to sicken and decay,It useth an enforced ceremony.There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;But when they should endure the bloody spur,They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?LUCILIUSThey mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;The greater part, the horse in general,Are come with Cassius.BRUTUSHark! he is arrived.Low march withinMarch gently on to meet him.Enter CASSIUS and his powersCASSIUSStand, ho!BRUTUSStand, ho!

Brutus's tent.Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUSCASSIUSThat you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:You have condemn'd and noted Lucius PellaFor taking bribes here of the Sardians;Wherein my letters, praying on his side,Because I knew the man, were slighted off.BRUTUSYou wronged yourself to write in such a case.CASSIUSIn such a time as this it is not meetThat every nice offence should bear his comment.BRUTUSLet me tell you, Cassius, you yourselfAre much condemn'd to have an itching palm;To sell and mart your offices for goldTo undeservers.CASSIUSI an itching palm!You know that you are Brutus that speak this,Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.BRUTUSThe name of Cassius honours this corruption,And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.CASSIUSChastisement!BRUTUSRemember March, the ides of March remember:Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,And not for justice? What, shall one of usThat struck the foremost man of all this worldBut for supporting robbers, shall we nowContaminate our fingers with base bribes,And sell the mighty space of our large honoursFor so much trash as may be grasped thus?I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,Than such a Roman.CASSIUSBrutus, bay not me;I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,Older in practise, abler than yourselfTo make conditions.BRUTUSGo to; you are not, Cassius.CASSIUSI am.BRUTUSI say you are not.CASSIUSUrge me no more, I shall forget myself;Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.BRUTUSAway, slight man!CASSIUSIs't possible?BRUTUSHear me, for I will speak.Must I give way and room to your rash choler?Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?CASSIUSO ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?BRUTUSAll this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;Go show your slaves how choleric you are,And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?Must I observe you? must I stand and crouchUnder your testy humour? By the godsYou shall digest the venom of your spleen,Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,When you are waspish.CASSIUSIs it come to this?BRUTUSYou say you are a better soldier:Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,And it shall please me well: for mine own part,I shall be glad to learn of noble men.CASSIUSYou wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;I said, an elder soldier, not a better:Did I say 'better'?BRUTUSIf you did, I care not.CASSIUSWhen Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.BRUTUSPeace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.CASSIUSI durst not!BRUTUSNo.CASSIUSWhat, durst not tempt him!BRUTUSFor your life you durst not!CASSIUSDo not presume too much upon my love;I may do that I shall be sorry for.BRUTUSYou have done that you should be sorry for.There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,For I am arm'd so strong in honestyThat they pass by me as the idle wind,Which I respect not. I did send to youFor certain sums of gold, which you denied me:For I can raise no money by vile means:By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wringFrom the hard hands of peasants their vile trashBy any indirection: I did sendTo you for gold to pay my legions,Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,To lock such rascal counters from his friends,Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;Dash him to pieces!CASSIUSI denied you not.BRUTUSYou did.CASSIUSI did not: he was but a fool that broughtMy answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.BRUTUSI do not, till you practise them on me.CASSIUSYou love me not.BRUTUSI do not like your faults.CASSIUSA friendly eye could never see such faults.BRUTUSA flatterer's would not, though they do appearAs huge as high Olympus.CASSIUSCome, Antony, and young Octavius, come,Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,For Cassius is aweary of the world;Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,To cast into my teeth. O, I could weepMy spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,And here my naked breast; within, a heartDearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him betterThan ever thou lovedst Cassius.BRUTUSSheathe your dagger:Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.O Cassius, you are yoked with a lambThat carries anger as the flint bears fire;Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,And straight is cold again.CASSIUSHath Cassius livedTo be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?BRUTUSWhen I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.CASSIUSDo you confess so much? Give me your hand.BRUTUSAnd my heart too.CASSIUSO Brutus!BRUTUSWhat's the matter?CASSIUSHave not you love enough to bear with me,When that rash humour which my mother gave meMakes me forgetful?BRUTUSYes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.Poet[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meetThey be alone.LUCILIUS[Within]  You shall not come to them.Poet[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUSCASSIUSHow now! what's the matter?PoetFor shame, you generals! what do you mean?Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.CASSIUSHa, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!BRUTUSGet you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!CASSIUSBear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.BRUTUSI'll know his humour, when he knows his time:What should the wars do with these jigging fools?Companion, hence!CASSIUSAway, away, be gone.Exit PoetBRUTUSLucilius and Titinius, bid the commandersPrepare to lodge their companies to-night.CASSIUSAnd come yourselves, and bring Messala with youImmediately to us.Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUSBRUTUSLucius, a bowl of wine!Exit LUCIUSCASSIUSI did not think you could have been so angry.BRUTUSO Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.CASSIUSOf your philosophy you make no use,If you give place to accidental evils.BRUTUSNo man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.CASSIUSHa! Portia!BRUTUSShe is dead.CASSIUSHow 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?O insupportable and touching loss!Upon what sickness?BRUTUSImpatient of my absence,And grief that young Octavius with Mark AntonyHave made themselves so strong:--for with her deathThat tidings came;--with this she fell distract,And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.CASSIUSAnd died so?BRUTUSEven so.CASSIUSO ye immortal gods!Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taperBRUTUSSpeak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.CASSIUSMy heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.BRUTUSCome in, Titinius!Exit LUCIUSRe-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALAWelcome, good Messala.Now sit we close about this taper here,And call in question our necessities.CASSIUSPortia, art thou gone?BRUTUSNo more, I pray you.Messala, I have here received letters,That young Octavius and Mark AntonyCome down upon us with a mighty power,Bending their expedition toward Philippi.MESSALAMyself have letters of the selfsame tenor.BRUTUSWith what addition?MESSALAThat by proscription and bills of outlawry,Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,Have put to death an hundred senators.BRUTUSTherein our letters do not well agree;Mine speak of seventy senators that diedBy their proscriptions, Cicero being one.CASSIUSCicero one!MESSALACicero is dead,And by that order of proscription.Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?BRUTUSNo, Messala.MESSALANor nothing in your letters writ of her?BRUTUSNothing, Messala.MESSALAThat, methinks, is strange.BRUTUSWhy ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?MESSALANo, my lord.BRUTUSNow, as you are a Roman, tell me true.MESSALAThen like a Roman bear the truth I tell:For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.BRUTUSWhy, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:With meditating that she must die once,I have the patience to endure it now.MESSALAEven so great men great losses should endure.CASSIUSI have as much of this in art as you,But yet my nature could not bear it so.BRUTUSWell, to our work alive. What do you thinkOf marching to Philippi presently?CASSIUSI do not think it good.BRUTUSYour reason?CASSIUSThis it is:'Tis better that the enemy seek us:So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.BRUTUSGood reasons must, of force, give place to better.The people 'twixt Philippi and this groundDo stand but in a forced affection;For they have grudged us contribution:The enemy, marching along by them,By them shall make a fuller number up,Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;From which advantage shall we cut him off,If at Philippi we do face him there,These people at our back.CASSIUSHear me, good brother.BRUTUSUnder your pardon. You must note beside,That we have tried the utmost of our friends,Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:The enemy increaseth every day;We, at the height, are ready to decline.There is a tide in the affairs of men,Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;Omitted, all the voyage of their lifeIs bound in shallows and in miseries.On such a full sea are we now afloat;And we must take the current when it serves,Or lose our ventures.CASSIUSThen, with your will, go on;We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.BRUTUSThe deep of night is crept upon our talk,And nature must obey necessity;Which we will niggard with a little rest.There is no more to say?CASSIUSNo more. Good night:Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.BRUTUSLucius!Enter LUCIUSMy gown.Exit LUCIUSFarewell, good Messala:Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,Good night, and good repose.CASSIUSO my dear brother!This was an ill beginning of the night:Never come such division 'tween our souls!Let it not, Brutus.BRUTUSEvery thing is well.CASSIUSGood night, my lord.BRUTUSGood night, good brother.TITINIUSMESSALAGood night, Lord Brutus.BRUTUSFarewell, every one.Exeunt all but BRUTUSRe-enter LUCIUS, with the gownGive me the gown. Where is thy instrument?LUCIUSHere in the tent.BRUTUSWhat, thou speak'st drowsily?Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.Call Claudius and some other of my men:I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.LUCIUSVarro and Claudius!Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUSVARROCalls my lord?BRUTUSI pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;It may be I shall raise you by and byOn business to my brother Cassius.VARROSo please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.BRUTUSI will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;I put it in the pocket of my gown.VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie downLUCIUSI was sure your lordship did not give it me.BRUTUSBear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,And touch thy instrument a strain or two?LUCIUSAy, my lord, an't please you.BRUTUSIt does, my boy:I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.LUCIUSIt is my duty, sir.BRUTUSI should not urge thy duty past thy might;I know young bloods look for a time of rest.LUCIUSI have slept, my lord, already.BRUTUSIt was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;I will not hold thee long: if I do live,I will be good to thee.Music, and a songThis is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd downWhere I left reading? Here it is, I think.Enter the Ghost of CAESARHow ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?I think it is the weakness of mine eyesThat shapes this monstrous apparition.It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?Speak to me what thou art.GHOSTThy evil spirit, Brutus.BRUTUSWhy comest thou?GHOSTTo tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.BRUTUSWell; then I shall see thee again?GHOSTAy, at Philippi.BRUTUSWhy, I will see thee at Philippi, then.Exit GhostNow I have taken heart thou vanishest:Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!LUCIUSThe strings, my lord, are false.BRUTUSHe thinks he still is at his instrument.Lucius, awake!LUCIUSMy lord?BRUTUSDidst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?LUCIUSMy lord, I do not know that I did cry.BRUTUSYes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?LUCIUSNothing, my lord.BRUTUSSleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!To VARROFellow thou, awake!VARROMy lord?CLAUDIUSMy lord?BRUTUSWhy did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?VARROCLAUDIUSDid we, my lord?BRUTUSAy: saw you any thing?VARRONo, my lord, I saw nothing.CLAUDIUSNor I, my lord.BRUTUSGo and commend me to my brother Cassius;Bid him set on his powers betimes before,And we will follow.VARROCLAUDIUSIt shall be done, my lord.ExeuntACT VSCENE I. The plains of Philippi.Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their armyOCTAVIUSNow, Antony, our hopes are answered:You said the enemy would not come down,But keep the hills and upper regions;It proves not so: their battles are at hand;They mean to warn us at Philippi here,Answering before we do demand of them.ANTONYTut, I am in their bosoms, and I knowWherefore they do it: they could be contentTo visit other places; and come downWith fearful bravery, thinking by this faceTo fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;But 'tis not so.Enter a MessengerMessengerPrepare you, generals:The enemy comes on in gallant show;Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,And something to be done immediately.ANTONYOctavius, lead your battle softly on,Upon the left hand of the even field.OCTAVIUSUpon the right hand I; keep thou the left.ANTONYWhy do you cross me in this exigent?OCTAVIUSI do not cross you; but I will do so.MarchDrum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and othersBRUTUSThey stand, and would have parley.CASSIUSStand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.OCTAVIUSMark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?ANTONYNo, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.Make forth; the generals would have some words.OCTAVIUSStir not until the signal.BRUTUSWords before blows: is it so, countrymen?OCTAVIUSNot that we love words better, as you do.BRUTUSGood words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.ANTONYIn your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'CASSIUSAntony,The posture of your blows are yet unknown;But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,And leave them honeyless.ANTONYNot stingless too.BRUTUSO, yes, and soundless too;For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,And very wisely threat before you sting.ANTONYVillains, you did not so, when your vile daggersHack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behindStruck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!CASSIUSFlatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:This tongue had not offended so to-day,If Cassius might have ruled.OCTAVIUSCome, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;I draw a sword against conspirators;When think you that the sword goes up again?Never, till Caesar's three and thirty woundsBe well avenged; or till another CaesarHave added slaughter to the sword of traitors.BRUTUSCaesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,Unless thou bring'st them with thee.OCTAVIUSSo I hope;I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.BRUTUSO, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.CASSIUSA peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,Join'd with a masker and a reveller!ANTONYOld Cassius still!OCTAVIUSCome, Antony, away!Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;If not, when you have stomachs.Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their armyCASSIUSWhy, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.BRUTUSHo, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.LUCILIUS[Standing forth]	My lord?BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apartCASSIUSMessala!MESSALA[Standing forth]  What says my general?CASSIUSMessala,This is my birth-day; as this very dayWas Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:Be thou my witness that against my will,As Pompey was, am I compell'd to setUpon one battle all our liberties.You know that I held Epicurus strongAnd his opinion: now I change my mind,And partly credit things that do presage.Coming from Sardis, on our former ensignTwo mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;Who to Philippi here consorted us:This morning are they fled away and gone;And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,As we were sickly prey: their shadows seemA canopy most fatal, under whichOur army lies, ready to give up the ghost.MESSALABelieve not so.CASSIUSI but believe it partly;For I am fresh of spirit and resolvedTo meet all perils very constantly.BRUTUSEven so, Lucilius.CASSIUSNow, most noble Brutus,The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,Let's reason with the worst that may befall.If we do lose this battle, then is thisThe very last time we shall speak together:What are you then determined to do?BRUTUSEven by the rule of that philosophyBy which I did blame Cato for the deathWhich he did give himself, I know not how,But I do find it cowardly and vile,For fear of what might fall, so to preventThe time of life: arming myself with patienceTo stay the providence of some high powersThat govern us below.CASSIUSThen, if we lose this battle,You are contented to be led in triumphThorough the streets of Rome?BRUTUSNo, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;He bears too great a mind. But this same dayMust end that work the ides of March begun;And whether we shall meet again I know not.Therefore our everlasting farewell take:For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;If not, why then, this parting was well made.CASSIUSFor ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.BRUTUSWhy, then, lead on. O, that a man might knowThe end of this day's business ere it come!But it sufficeth that the day will end,And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!ExeuntSCENE II. The same. The field of battle.Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALABRUTUSRide, ride, Messala, ride, and give these billsUnto the legions on the other side.Loud alarumLet them set on at once; for I perceiveBut cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,And sudden push gives them the overthrow.Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.ExeuntSCENE III. Another part of the field.Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUSCASSIUSO, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:This ensign here of mine was turning back;I slew the coward, and did take it from him.TITINIUSO Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;Who, having some advantage on Octavius,Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.Enter PINDARUSPINDARUSFly further off, my lord, fly further off;Mark Antony is in your tents, my lordFly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.CASSIUSThis hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?TITINIUSThey are, my lord.CASSIUSTitinius, if thou lovest me,Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,And here again; that I may rest assuredWhether yond troops are friend or enemy.TITINIUSI will be here again, even with a thought.ExitCASSIUSGo, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,And tell me what thou notest about the field.PINDARUS ascends the hillThis day I breathed first: time is come round,And where I did begin, there shall I end;My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?PINDARUS[Above]  O my lord!CASSIUSWhat news?PINDARUS[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round aboutWith horsemen, that make to him on the spur;Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.He's ta'en.ShoutAnd, hark! they shout for joy.CASSIUSCome down, behold no more.O, coward that I am, to live so long,To see my best friend ta'en before my face!PINDARUS descendsCome hither, sirrah:In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,That whatsoever I did bid thee do,Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,Guide thou the sword.PINDARUS stabs himCaesar, thou art revenged,Even with the sword that kill'd thee.DiesPINDARUSSo, I am free; yet would not so have been,Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,Far from this country Pindarus shall run,Where never Roman shall take note of him.ExitRe-enter TITINIUS with MESSALAMESSALAIt is but change, Titinius; for OctaviusIs overthrown by noble Brutus' power,As Cassius' legions are by Antony.TITINIUSThese tidings will well comfort Cassius.MESSALAWhere did you leave him?TITINIUSAll disconsolate,With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.MESSALAIs not that he t hat lies upon the ground?TITINIUSHe lies not like the living. O my heart!MESSALAIs not that he?TITINIUSNo, this was he, Messala,But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.MESSALAMistrust of good success hath done this deed.O hateful error, melancholy's child,Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of menThe things that are not? O error, soon conceived,Thou never comest unto a happy birth,But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!TITINIUSWhat, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?MESSALASeek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meetThe noble Brutus, thrusting this reportInto his ears; I may say, thrusting it;For piercing steel and darts envenomedShall be as welcome to the ears of BrutusAs tidings of this sight.TITINIUSHie you, Messala,And I will seek for Pindarus the while.Exit MESSALAWhy didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?Did I not meet thy friends? and did not theyPut on my brows this wreath of victory,And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and IWill do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's partCome, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.Kills himselfAlarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUSBRUTUSWhere, where, Messala, doth his body lie?MESSALALo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.BRUTUSTitinius' face is upward.CATOHe is slain.BRUTUSO Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swordsIn our own proper entrails.Low alarumsCATOBrave Titinius!Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!BRUTUSAre yet two Romans living such as these?The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!It is impossible that ever RomeShould breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tearsTo this dead man than you shall see me pay.I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:His funerals shall not be in our camp,Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;And come, young Cato; let us to the field.Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere nightWe shall try fortune in a second fight.ExeuntSCENE IV.

A noble prisoner!Second SoldierRoom, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.First SoldierI'll tell the news. Here comes the general.Enter ANTONYBrutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.ANTONYWhere is he?LUCILIUSSafe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:I dare assure thee that no enemyShall ever take alive the noble Brutus:The gods defend him from so great a shame!When you do find him, or alive or dead,He will be found like Brutus, like himself.ANTONYThis is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;Give him all kindness: I had rather haveSuch men my friends than enemies. Go on,And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;And bring us word unto Octavius' tentHow every thing is chanced.ExeuntSCENE V.

Hark thee, Clitus.WhispersCLITUSWhat, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.BRUTUSPeace then! no words.CLITUSI'll rather kill myself.BRUTUSHark thee, Dardanius.WhispersDARDANIUSShall I do such a deed?CLITUSO Dardanius!DARDANIUSO Clitus!CLITUSWhat ill request did Brutus make to thee?DARDANIUSTo kill him, Clitus.

Good Volumnius,Thou know'st that we two went to school together:Even for that our love of old, I prithee,Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.VOLUMNIUSThat's not an office for a friend, my lord.Alarum stillCLITUSFly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.BRUTUSFarewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,My heart doth joy that yet in all my lifeI found no man but he was true to me.I shall have glory by this losing dayMore than Octavius and Mark AntonyBy this vile conquest shall attain unto.So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongueHath almost ended his life's history:Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,That have but labour'd to attain this hour.Alarum.

Strato, where is thy master?STRATOFree from the bondage you are in, Messala:The conquerors can but make a fire of him;For Brutus only overcame himself,And no man else hath honour by his death.LUCILIUSSo Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.OCTAVIUSAll that served Brutus, I will entertain them.Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?STRATOAy, if Messala will prefer me to you.OCTAVIUSDo so, good Messala.MESSALAHow died my master, Strato?STRATOI held the sword, and he did run on it.MESSALAOctavius, then take him to follow thee,That did the latest service to my master.ANTONYThis was the noblest Roman of them all:All the conspirators save only heDid that they did in envy of great Caesar;He only, in a general honest thoughtAnd common good to all, made one of them.His life was gentle, and the elementsSo mix'd in him that Nature might stand upAnd say to all the world 'This was a man!'OCTAVIUSAccording to his virtue let us use him,With all respect and rites of burial.Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.So call the field to rest; and let's away,To part the glories of this happy day.Exeunt
