ACT ISCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other AttendantsAEGEONProceed, Solinus, to procure my fallAnd by the doom of death end woes and all.DUKE SOLINUSMerchant of Syracuse, plead no more;I am not partial to infringe our laws:The enmity and discord which of lateSprung from the rancorous outrage of your dukeTo merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,Who wanting guilders to redeem their livesHave seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.For, since the mortal and intestine jars'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,It hath in solemn synods been decreedBoth by the Syracusians and ourselves,To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,If any born at Ephesus be seenAt any Syracusian marts and fairs;Again: if any Syracusian bornCome to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,Unless a thousand marks be levied,To quit the penalty and to ransom him.Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.AEGEONYet this my comfort: when your words are done,My woes end likewise with the evening sun.DUKE SOLINUSWell, Syracusian, say in brief the causeWhy thou departed'st from thy native homeAnd for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.AEGEONA heavier task could not have been imposedThan I to speak my griefs unspeakable:Yet, that the world may witness that my endWas wrought by nature, not by vile offence,I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.In Syracusa was I born, and wedUnto a woman, happy but for me,And by me, had not our hap been bad.With her I lived in joy; our wealth increasedBy prosperous voyages I often madeTo Epidamnum; till my factor's deathAnd the great care of goods at random leftDrew me from kind embracements of my spouse:From whom my absence was not six months oldBefore herself, almost at fainting underThe pleasing punishment that women bear,Had made provision for her following meAnd soon and safe arrived where I was.There had she not been long, but she becameA joyful mother of two goodly sons;And, which was strange, the one so like the other,As could not be distinguish'd but by names.That very hour, and in the self-same inn,A meaner woman was deliveredOf such a burden, male twins, both alike:Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--I bought and brought up to attend my sons.My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,Made daily motions for our home return:Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,We came aboard.A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,Before the always wind-obeying deepGave any tragic instance of our harm:But longer did we not retain much hope;For what obscured light the heavens did grantDid but convey unto our fearful mindsA doubtful warrant of immediate death;Which though myself would gladly have embraced,Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,Weeping before for what she saw must come,And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,Forced me to seek delays for them and me.And this it was, for other means was none:The sailors sought for safety by our boat,And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:My wife, more careful for the latter-born,Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,Such as seafaring men provide for storms;To him one of the other twins was bound,Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:The children thus disposed, my wife and I,Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;And floating straight, obedient to the stream,Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,Dispersed those vapours that offended us;And by the benefit of his wished light,The seas wax'd calm, and we discoveredTwo ships from far making amain to us,Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!Gather the sequel by that went before.DUKE SOLINUSNay, forward, old man; do not break off so;For we may pity, though not pardon thee.AEGEONO, had the gods done so, I had not nowWorthily term'd them merciless to us!For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,We were encounterd by a mighty rock;Which being violently borne upon,Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;So that, in this unjust divorce of us,Fortune had left to both of us alikeWhat to delight in, what to sorrow for.Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdenedWith lesser weight but not with lesser woe,Was carried with more speed before the wind;And in our sight they three were taken upBy fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.At length, another ship had seized on us;And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;And would have reft the fishers of their prey,Had not their bark been very slow of sail;And therefore homeward did they bend their course.Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.DUKE SOLINUSAnd for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,Do me the favour to dilate at fullWhat hath befall'n of them and thee till now.AEGEONMy youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,At eighteen years became inquisitiveAfter his brother: and importuned meThat his attendant--so his case was like,Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--Might bear him company in the quest of him:Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsoughtOr that or any place that harbours men.But here must end the story of my life;And happy were I in my timely death,Could all my travels warrant me they live.DUKE SOLINUSHapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'dTo bear the extremity of dire mishap!Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,Which princes, would they, may not disannul,My soul would sue as advocate for thee.But, though thou art adjudged to the deathAnd passed sentence may not be recall'dBut to our honour's great disparagement,Yet I will favour thee in what I can.Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this dayTo seek thy life by beneficial help:Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.Gaoler, take him to thy custody.GaolerI will, my lord.AEGEONHopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,But to procrastinate his lifeless end.ExeuntSCENE II. The Mart.Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First MerchantFirst MerchantTherefore give out you are of Epidamnum,Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.This very day a Syracusian merchantIs apprehended for arrival here;And not being able to buy out his lifeAccording to the statute of the town,Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.There is your money that I had to keep.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEGo bear it to the Centaur, where we host,And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.Within this hour it will be dinner-time:Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,And then return and sleep within mine inn,For with long travel I am stiff and weary.Get thee away.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMany a man would take you at your word,And go indeed, having so good a mean.ExitANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEA trusty villain, sir, that very oft,When I am dull with care and melancholy,Lightens my humour with his merry jests.What, will you walk with me about the town,And then go to my inn and dine with me?First MerchantI am invited, sir, to certain merchants,Of whom I hope to make much benefit;I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,Please you, I'll meet with you upon the martAnd afterward consort you till bed-time:My present business calls me from you now.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEFarewell till then: I will go lose myselfAnd wander up and down to view the city.First MerchantSir, I commend you to your own content.ExitANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEHe that commends me to mine own contentCommends me to the thing I cannot get.I to the world am like a drop of waterThat in the ocean seeks another drop,Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:So I, to find a mother and a brother,In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.Enter DROMIO of EphesusHere comes the almanac of my true date.What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?DROMIO OF EPHESUSReturn'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;My mistress made it one upon my cheek:She is so hot because the meat is cold;The meat is cold because you come not home;You come not home because you have no stomach;You have no stomach having broke your fast;But we that know what 'tis to fast and prayAre penitent for your default to-day.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEStop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:Where have you left the money that I gave you?DROMIO OF EPHESUSO,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday lastTo pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEI am not in a sportive humour now:Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?We being strangers here, how darest thou trustSo great a charge from thine own custody?DROMIO OF EPHESUSI pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:I from my mistress come to you in post;If I return, I shall be post indeed,For she will score your fault upon my pate.Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,And strike you home without a messenger.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSECome, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?DROMIO OF EPHESUSTo me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSECome on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.DROMIO OF EPHESUSMy charge was but to fetch you from the martHome to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:My mistress and her sister stays for you.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEIn what safe place you have bestow'd my money,Or I shall break that merry sconce of yoursThat stands on tricks when I am undisposed:Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?DROMIO OF EPHESUSI have some marks of yours upon my pate,Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,But not a thousand marks between you both.If I should pay your worship those again,Perchance you will not bear them patiently.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?DROMIO OF EPHESUSYour worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.DROMIO OF EPHESUSWhat mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.ExitANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEUpon my life, by some device or otherThe villain is o'er-raught of all my money.They say this town is full of cozenage,As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,Soul-killing witches that deform the body,Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,And many such-like liberties of sin:If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:I greatly fear my money is not safe.ExitACT IISCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANAADRIANANeither my husband nor the slave return'd,That in such haste I sent to seek his master!Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.LUCIANAPerhaps some merchant hath invited him,And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.Good sister, let us dine and never fret:A man is master of his liberty:Time is their master, and, when they see time,They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.ADRIANAWhy should their liberty than ours be more?LUCIANABecause their business still lies out o' door.ADRIANALook, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.LUCIANAO, know he is the bridle of your will.ADRIANAThere's none but asses will be bridled so.LUCIANAWhy, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.There's nothing situate under heaven's eyeBut hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,Are their males' subjects and at their controls:Men, more divine, the masters of all these,Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,Indued with intellectual sense and souls,Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,Are masters to their females, and their lords:Then let your will attend on their accords.ADRIANAThis servitude makes you to keep unwed.LUCIANANot this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.ADRIANABut, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.LUCIANAEre I learn love, I'll practise to obey.ADRIANAHow if your husband start some other where?LUCIANATill he come home again, I would forbear.ADRIANAPatience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;They can be meek that have no other cause.A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;But were we burdened with like weight of pain,As much or more would we ourselves complain:So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,But, if thou live to see like right bereft,This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.LUCIANAWell, I will marry one day, but to try.Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.Enter DROMIO of EphesusADRIANASay, is your tardy master now at hand?DROMIO OF EPHESUSNay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two earscan witness.ADRIANASay, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?DROMIO OF EPHESUSAy, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.LUCIANASpake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?DROMIO OF EPHESUSNay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel hisblows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarceunderstand them.ADRIANABut say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems hehath great care to please his wife.DROMIO OF EPHESUSWhy, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.ADRIANAHorn-mad, thou villain!DROMIO OF EPHESUSI mean not cuckold-mad;But, sure, he is stark mad.When I desired him to come home to dinner,He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?''The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'LUCIANAQuoth who?DROMIO OF EPHESUSQuoth my master:'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'So that my errand, due unto my tongue,I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.ADRIANAGo back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.DROMIO OF EPHESUSGo back again, and be new beaten home?For God's sake, send some other messenger.ADRIANABack, slave, or I will break thy pate across.DROMIO OF EPHESUSAnd he will bless that cross with other beating:Between you I shall have a holy head.ADRIANAHence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.DROMIO OF EPHESUSAm I so round with you as you with me,That like a football you do spurn me thus?You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.ExitLUCIANAFie, how impatience loureth in your face!ADRIANAHis company must do his minions grace,Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.Hath homely age the alluring beauty tookFrom my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:Do their gay vestments his affections bait?That's not my fault: he's master of my state:What ruins are in me that can be found,By him not ruin'd? then is he the groundOf my defeatures. My decayed fairA sunny look of his would soon repairBut, too unruly deer, he breaks the paleAnd feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.LUCIANASelf-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!ADRIANAUnfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,Or else what lets it but he would be here?Sister, you know he promised me a chain;Would that alone, alone he would detain,So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!I see the jewel best enamelledWill lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,That others touch, and often touching willWear gold: and no man that hath a name,By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.LUCIANAHow many fond fools serve mad jealousy!ExeuntSCENE II. A public place.Enter ANTIPHOLUS of SyracuseANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThe gold I gave to Dromio is laid upSafe at the Centaur; and the heedful slaveIs wander'd forth, in care to seek me outBy computation and mine host's report.I could not speak with Dromio since at firstI sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.Enter DROMIO of SyracuseHow now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?As you love strokes, so jest with me again.You know no Centaur? you received no gold?Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,That thus so madly thou didst answer me?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEWhat answer, sir? when spake I such a word?ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEEven now, even here, not half an hour since.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI did not see you since you sent me hence,Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEVillain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI am glad to see you in this merry vein:What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEYea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.Beating himDROMIO OF SYRACUSEHold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:Upon what bargain do you give it me?ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEBecause that I familiarly sometimesDo use you for my fool and chat with you,Your sauciness will jest upon my loveAnd make a common of my serious hours.When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.If you will jest with me, know my aspect,And fashion your demeanor to my looks,Or I will beat this method in your sconce.DROMIO OF SYRACUSESconce call you it? so you would leave battering, Ihad rather have it a head: an you use these blowslong, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconceit too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEDost thou not know?DROMIO OF SYRACUSENothing, sir, but that I am beaten.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEShall I tell you why?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEAy, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hatha wherefore.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhy, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--For urging it the second time to me.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEWas there ever any man thus beaten out of season,When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhymenor reason?Well, sir, I thank you.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThank me, sir, for what?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEI'll make you amends next, to give you nothing forsomething. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?DROMIO OF SYRACUSENo, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEIn good time, sir; what's that?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEBasting.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWell, sir, then 'twill be dry.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEIf it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEYour reason?DROMIO OF SYRACUSELest it make you choleric and purchase me anotherdry basting.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWell, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's atime for all things.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEBy what rule, sir?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain baldpate of father Time himself.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSELet's hear it.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEThere's no time for a man to recover his hair thatgrows bald by nature.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEMay he not do it by fine and recovery?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEYes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover thelost hair of another man.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhy is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,so plentiful an excrement?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEBecause it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhy, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.DROMIO OF SYRACUSENot a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhy, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEThe plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he losethit in a kind of jollity.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEFor what reason?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEFor two; and sound ones too.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSENay, not sound, I pray you.DROMIO OF SYRACUSESure ones, then.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSENay, not sure, in a thing falsing.DROMIO OF SYRACUSECertain ones then.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEName them.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEThe one, to save the money that he spends intrimming; the other, that at dinner they should notdrop in his porridge.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEYou would all this time have proved there is notime for all things.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hairlost by nature.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEBut your reason was not substantial, why there is notime to recover.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEThus I mend it: Time himself is bald and thereforeto the world's end will have bald followers.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEI knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:But, soft! who wafts us yonder?Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANAADRIANAAy, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;I am not Adriana nor thy wife.The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vowThat never words were music to thine ear,That never object pleasing in thine eye,That never touch well welcome to thy hand,That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,That thou art thus estranged from thyself?Thyself I call it, being strange to me,That, undividable, incorporate,Am better than thy dear self's better part.Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fallA drop of water in the breaking gulf,And take unmingled that same drop again,Without addition or diminishing,As take from me thyself and not me too.How dearly would it touch me to the quick,Shouldst thou but hear I were licentiousAnd that this body, consecrate to thee,By ruffian lust should be contaminate!Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at meAnd hurl the name of husband in my faceAnd tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-browAnd from my false hand cut the wedding-ringAnd break it with a deep-divorcing vow?I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:For if we too be one and thou play false,I do digest the poison of thy flesh,Being strumpeted by thy contagion.Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEPlead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:In Ephesus I am but two hours old,As strange unto your town as to your talk;Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,Want wit in all one word to understand.LUCIANAFie, brother! how the world is changed with you!When were you wont to use my sister thus?She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEBy Dromio?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEBy me?ADRIANABy thee; and this thou didst return from him,That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,Denied my house for his, me for his wife.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEDid you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?What is the course and drift of your compact?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI, sir? I never saw her till this time.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEVillain, thou liest; for even her very wordsDidst thou deliver to me on the mart.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI never spake with her in all my life.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEHow can she thus then call us by our names,Unless it be by inspiration.ADRIANAHow ill agrees it with your gravityTo counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,Makes me with thy strength to communicate:If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusionInfect thy sap and live on thy confusion.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSETo me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:What, was I married to her in my dream?Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?Until I know this sure uncertainty,I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.LUCIANADromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEO, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:If we obey them not, this will ensue,They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.LUCIANAWhy pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI am transformed, master, am I not?ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEI think thou art in mind, and so am I.DROMIO OF SYRACUSENay, master, both in mind and in my shape.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThou hast thine own form.DROMIO OF SYRACUSENo, I am an ape.LUCIANAIf thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.DROMIO OF SYRACUSE'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never beBut I should know her as well as she knows me.ADRIANACome, come, no longer will I be a fool,To put the finger in the eye and weep,Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.Husband, I'll dine above with you to-dayAnd shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEAm I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?Known unto these, and to myself disguised!I'll say as they say and persever so,And in this mist at all adventures go.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMaster, shall I be porter at the gate?ADRIANAAy; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.LUCIANACome, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZARANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSGood Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:Say that I linger'd with you at your shopTo see the making of her carcanet,And that to-morrow you will bring it home.But here's a villain that would face me downHe met me on the mart, and that I beat him,And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,And that I did deny my wife and house.Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?DROMIO OF EPHESUSSay what you will, sir, but I know what I know;That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSI think thou art an ass.DROMIO OF EPHESUSMarry, so it doth appearBy the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSYou're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheerMay answer my good will and your good welcome here.BALTHAZARI hold your dainties cheap, sir, and yourwelcome dear.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSO, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.BALTHAZARGood meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSAnd welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.BALTHAZARSmall cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSAy, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.But, soft! my door is lock'd.

I havebut lean luck in the match, and yet is she awondrous fat marriage.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEHow dost thou mean a fat marriage?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;and I know not what use to put her to but to make alamp of her and run from her by her own light. Iwarrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn aPoland winter: if she lives till doomsday,she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat complexion is she of?DROMIO OF SYRACUSESwart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half soclean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go overshoes in the grime of it.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThat's a fault that water will mend.DROMIO OF SYRACUSENo, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat's her name?DROMIO OF SYRACUSENell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that'san ell and three quarters, will not measure her fromhip to hip.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThen she bears some breadth?DROMIO OF SYRACUSENo longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:she is spherical, like a globe; I could find outcountries in her.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEIn what part of her body stands Ireland?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere Scotland?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere France?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEIn her forehead; armed and reverted, making waragainst her heir.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere England?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEI looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find nowhiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere Spain?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEFaith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere America, the Indies?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEOh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished withrubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their richaspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent wholearmadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhere stood Belgia, the Netherlands?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEOh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, thisdrudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd meDromio; swore I was assured to her; told me whatprivy marks I had about me, as, the mark of myshoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on myleft arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:And, I think, if my breast had not been made offaith and my heart of steel,She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and mademe turn i' the wheel.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEGo hie thee presently, post to the road:An if the wind blow any way from shore,I will not harbour in this town to-night:If any bark put forth, come to the mart,Where I will walk till thou return to me.If every one knows us and we know none,'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEAs from a bear a man would run for life,So fly I from her that would be my wife.ExitANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEThere's none but witches do inhabit here;And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.She that doth call me husband, even my soulDoth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,Of such enchanting presence and discourse,Hath almost made me traitor to myself:But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.Enter ANGELO with the chainANGELOMaster Antipholus,--ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEAy, that's my name.ANGELOI know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat is your will that I shall do with this?ANGELOWhat please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEMade it for me, sir!

Have you the chain about you?ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSAn if I have not, sir, I hope you have;Or else you may return without your money.ANGELONay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,And I, to blame, have held him here too long.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSGood Lord! you use this dalliance to excuseYour breach of promise to the Porpentine.I should have chid you for not bringing it,But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.Second MerchantThe hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.ANGELOYou hear how he importunes me;--the chain!ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSWhy, give it to my wife and fetch your money.ANGELOCome, come, you know I gave it you even now.Either send the chain or send me by some token.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUSFie, now you run this humour out of breath,where's the chain?

What, haveyou got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?DROMIO OF SYRACUSENot that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adamthat keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf'sskin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that camebehind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid youforsake your liberty.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEI understand thee not.DROMIO OF SYRACUSENo? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like abass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a soband 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayedmen and gives them suits of durance; he that sets uphis rest to do more exploits with his mace than amorris-pike.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhat, thou meanest an officer?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEAy, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that bringsany man to answer it that breaks his band; one thatthinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'Godgive you good rest!'ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWell, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there anyDROMIO OF SYRACUSEWhy, sir, I brought you word an hour since that thebark Expedition put forth to-night; and then wereyou hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoyDelay.

I charge thee, tempt me not.DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMaster, is this Mistress Satan?ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEIt is the devil.DROMIO OF SYRACUSENay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and hereshe comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereofcomes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's asmuch to say 'God make me a light wench.' It iswritten, they appear to men like angels of light:light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.CourtezanYour man and you are marvellous merry, sir.Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMaster, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak along spoon.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEWhy, Dromio?DROMIO OF SYRACUSEMarry, he must have a long spoon that must eat withthe devil.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEAvoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.CourtezanGive me the ring of mine you had at dinner,Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.DROMIO OF SYRACUSESome devils ask but the parings of one's nail,A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,A nut, a cherry-stone;But she, more covetous, would have a chain.Master, be wise: an if you give it her,The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.CourtezanI pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.ANTIPHOLUSOF SYRACUSEAvaunt, thou witch!

Then they fledInto this abbey, whither we pursued them:And here the abbess shuts the gates on usAnd will not suffer us to fetch him out,Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy commandLet him be brought forth and borne hence for help.DUKE SOLINUSLong since thy husband served me in my wars,And I to thee engaged a prince's word,When thou didst make him master of thy bed,To do him all the grace and good I could.Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gateAnd bid the lady abbess come to me.I will determine this before I stir.Enter a ServantServantO mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!My master and his man are both broke loose,Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctorWhose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;And ever, as it blazed, they threw on himGreat pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:My master preaches patience to him and the whileHis man with scissors nicks him like a fool,And sure, unless you send some present help,Between them they will kill the conjurer.ADRIANAPeace, fool! thy master and his man are here,And that is false thou dost report to us.ServantMistress, upon my life, I tell you true;I have not breathed almost since I did see it.He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,To scorch your face and to disfigure you.Cry withinHark, hark!

Sirrah, what say you?DROMIO OF EPHESUSSir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.CourtezanHe did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.ANTIPHOLUSOF EPHESUS'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.DUKE SOLINUSSaw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?CourtezanAs sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.DUKE SOLINUSWhy, this is strange.
