ACT ISCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attendingDUKE ORSINOIf music be the food of love, play on;Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,The appetite may sicken, and so die.That strain again! it had a dying fall:O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,That breathes upon a bank of violets,Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,That, notwithstanding thy capacityReceiveth as the sea, nought enters there,Of what validity and pitch soe'er,But falls into abatement and low price,Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancyThat it alone is high fantastical.CURIOWill you go hunt, my lord?DUKE ORSINOWhat, Curio?CURIOThe hart.DUKE ORSINOWhy, so I do, the noblest that I have:O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,Methought she purged the air of pestilence!That instant was I turn'd into a hart;And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,E'er since pursue me.Enter VALENTINEHow now! what news from her?VALENTINESo please my lord, I might not be admitted;But from her handmaid do return this answer:The element itself, till seven years' heat,Shall not behold her face at ample view;But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walkAnd water once a day her chamber roundWith eye-offending brine: all this to seasonA brother's dead love, which she would keep freshAnd lasting in her sad remembrance.DUKE ORSINOO, she that hath a heart of that fine frameTo pay this debt of love but to a brother,How will she love, when the rich golden shaftHath kill'd the flock of all affections elseThat live in her; when liver, brain and heart,These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'dHer sweet perfections with one self king!Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.ExeuntSCENE II. The sea-coast.Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and SailorsVIOLAWhat country, friends, is this?CaptainThis is Illyria, lady.VIOLAAnd what should I do in Illyria?My brother he is in Elysium.Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?CaptainIt is perchance that you yourself were saved.VIOLAO my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.CaptainTrue, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,Assure yourself, after our ship did split,When you and those poor number saved with youHung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,Most provident in peril, bind himself,Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,I saw him hold acquaintance with the wavesSo long as I could see.VIOLAFor saying so, there's gold:Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,Whereto thy speech serves for authority,The like of him. Know'st thou this country?CaptainAy, madam, well; for I was bred and bornNot three hours' travel from this very place.VIOLAWho governs here?CaptainA noble duke, in nature as in name.VIOLAWhat is the name?CaptainOrsino.VIOLAOrsino! I have heard my father name him:He was a bachelor then.CaptainAnd so is now, or was so very late;For but a month ago I went from hence,And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,What great ones do the less will prattle of,--That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.VIOLAWhat's she?CaptainA virtuous maid, the daughter of a countThat died some twelvemonth since, then leaving herIn the protection of his son, her brother,Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,They say, she hath abjured the companyAnd sight of men.VIOLAO that I served that ladyAnd might not be delivered to the world,Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,What my estate is!CaptainThat were hard to compass;Because she will admit no kind of suit,No, not the duke's.VIOLAThere is a fair behavior in thee, captain;And though that nature with a beauteous wallDoth oft close in pollution, yet of theeI will believe thou hast a mind that suitsWith this thy fair and outward character.I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,Conceal me what I am, and be my aidFor such disguise as haply shall becomeThe form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:It may be worth thy pains; for I can singAnd speak to him in many sorts of musicThat will allow me very worth his service.What else may hap to time I will commit;Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.CaptainBe you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.VIOLAI thank thee: lead me on.ExeuntSCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIASIR TOBY BELCHWhat a plague means my niece, to take the death ofher brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.MARIABy my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'nights: your cousin, my lady, takes greatexceptions to your ill hours.SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, let her except, before excepted.MARIAAy, but you must confine yourself within the modestlimits of order.SIR TOBY BELCHConfine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so bethese boots too: an they be not, let them hangthemselves in their own straps.MARIAThat quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heardmy lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolishknight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.SIR TOBY BELCHWho, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?MARIAAy, he.SIR TOBY BELCHHe's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.MARIAWhat's that to the purpose?SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, he has three thousand ducats a year.MARIAAy, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:he's a very fool and a prodigal.SIR TOBY BELCHFie, that you'll say so! he plays o' theviol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languagesword for word without book, and hath all the goodgifts of nature.MARIAHe hath indeed, almost natural: for besides thathe's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but thathe hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust hehath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudenthe would quickly have the gift of a grave.SIR TOBY BELCHBy this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractorsthat say so of him. Who are they?MARIAThey that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.SIR TOBY BELCHWith drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink toher as long as there is a passage in my throat anddrink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrillthat will not drink to my niece till his brains turno' the toe like a parish-top.

Is that the meaning of 'accost'?MARIAFare you well, gentlemen.SIR TOBY BELCHAn thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightstnever draw sword again.SIR ANDREWAn you part so, mistress, I would I might neverdraw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you havefools in hand?MARIASir, I have not you by the hand.SIR ANDREWMarry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.MARIANow, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bringyour hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.SIR ANDREWWherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?MARIAIt's dry, sir.SIR ANDREWWhy, I think so: I am not such an ass but I cankeep my hand dry. But what's your jest?MARIAA dry jest, sir.SIR ANDREWAre you full of them?MARIAAy, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,now I let go your hand, I am barren.ExitSIR TOBY BELCHO knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did Isee thee so put down?SIR ANDREWNever in your life, I think; unless you see canaryput me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more witthan a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am agreat eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.SIR TOBY BELCHNo question.SIR ANDREWAn I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride hometo-morrow, Sir Toby.SIR TOBY BELCHPourquoi, my dear knight?SIR ANDREWWhat is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I hadbestowed that time in the tongues that I have infencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I butfollowed the arts!SIR TOBY BELCHThen hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.SIR ANDREWWhy, would that have mended my hair?SIR TOBY BELCHPast question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.SIR ANDREWBut it becomes me well enough, does't not?SIR TOBY BELCHExcellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and Ihope to see a housewife take thee between her legsand spin it off.SIR ANDREWFaith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niecewill not be seen; or if she be, it's four to oneshe'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.SIR TOBY BELCHShe'll none o' the count: she'll not match aboveher degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; Ihave heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,man.SIR ANDREWI'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' thestrangest mind i' the world; I delight in masquesand revels sometimes altogether.SIR TOBY BELCHArt thou good at these kickshawses, knight?SIR ANDREWAs any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under thedegree of my betters; and yet I will not comparewith an old man.SIR TOBY BELCHWhat is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?SIR ANDREWFaith, I can cut a caper.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd I can cut the mutton to't.SIR ANDREWAnd I think I have the back-trick simply as strongas any man in Illyria.SIR TOBY BELCHWherefore are these things hid? wherefore havethese gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like totake dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dostthou not go to church in a galliard and come home ina coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would notso much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. Whatdost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?I did think, by the excellent constitution of thyleg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.SIR ANDREWAy, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in aflame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?SIR TOBY BELCHWhat shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?SIR ANDREWTaurus! That's sides and heart.SIR TOBY BELCHNo, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see thecaper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!ExeuntSCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attireVALENTINEIf the duke continue these favours towards you,Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hathknown you but three days, and already you are no stranger.VIOLAYou either fear his humour or my negligence, thatyou call in question the continuance of his love:is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?VALENTINENo, believe me.VIOLAI thank you. Here comes the count.Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and AttendantsDUKE ORSINOWho saw Cesario, ho?VIOLAOn your attendance, my lord; here.DUKE ORSINOStand you a while aloof, Cesario,Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'dTo thee the book even of my secret soul:Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;Be not denied access, stand at her doors,And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall growTill thou have audience.VIOLASure, my noble lord,If she be so abandon'd to her sorrowAs it is spoke, she never will admit me.DUKE ORSINOBe clamorous and leap all civil boundsRather than make unprofited return.VIOLASay I do speak with her, my lord, what then?DUKE ORSINOO, then unfold the passion of my love,Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:It shall become thee well to act my woes;She will attend it better in thy youthThan in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.VIOLAI think not so, my lord.DUKE ORSINODear lad, believe it;For they shall yet belie thy happy years,That say thou art a man: Diana's lipIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipeIs as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,And all is semblative a woman's part.I know thy constellation is right aptFor this affair. Some four or five attend him;All, if you will; for I myself am bestWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,To call his fortunes thine.VIOLAI'll do my bestTo woo your lady:Asideyet, a barful strife!Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.ExeuntSCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.Enter MARIA and ClownMARIANay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I willnot open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter inway of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.ClownLet her hang me: he that is well hanged in thisworld needs to fear no colours.MARIAMake that good.ClownHe shall see none to fear.MARIAA good lenten answer: I can tell thee where thatsaying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'ClownWhere, good Mistress Mary?MARIAIn the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.ClownWell, God give them wisdom that have it; and thosethat are fools, let them use their talents.MARIAYet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?ClownMany a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,for turning away, let summer bear it out.MARIAYou are resolute, then?ClownNot so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.MARIAThat if one break, the other will hold; or, if bothbreak, your gaskins fall.ClownApt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; ifSir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty apiece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.MARIAPeace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes mylady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.ExitClownWit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oftprove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, maypass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIOGod bless thee, lady!OLIVIATake the fool away.ClownDo you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.OLIVIAGo to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:besides, you grow dishonest.ClownTwo faults, madonna, that drink and good counselwill amend: for give the dry fool drink, then isthe fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mendhimself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; ifhe cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thingthat's mended is but patched: virtue thattransgresses is but patched with sin; and sin thatamends is but patched with virtue. If that thissimple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,what remedy? As there is no true cuckold butcalamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade takeaway the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.OLIVIASir, I bade them take away you.ClownMisprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus nonfacit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear notmotley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave toprove you a fool.OLIVIACan you do it?ClownDexterously, good madonna.OLIVIAMake your proof.ClownI must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouseof virtue, answer me.OLIVIAWell, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.ClownGood madonna, why mournest thou?OLIVIAGood fool, for my brother's death.ClownI think his soul is in hell, madonna.OLIVIAI know his soul is in heaven, fool.ClownThe more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother'ssoul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.OLIVIAWhat think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?MALVOLIOYes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make thebetter fool.ClownGod send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for thebetter increasing your folly! Sir Toby will besworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass hisword for two pence that you are no fool.OLIVIAHow say you to that, Malvolio?MALVOLIOI marvel your ladyship takes delight in such abarren rascal: I saw him put down the other daywith an ordinary fool that has no more brainthan a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guardalready; unless you laugh and minister occasion tohim, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,that crow so at these set kind of fools, no betterthan the fools' zanies.OLIVIAOh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and tastewith a distempered appetite. To be generous,guiltless and of free disposition, is to take thosethings for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he donothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreetman, though he do nothing but reprove.ClownNow Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thouspeakest well of fools!Re-enter MARIAMARIAMadam, there is at the gate a young gentleman muchdesires to speak with you.OLIVIAFrom the Count Orsino, is it?MARIAI know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.OLIVIAWho of my people hold him in delay?MARIASir Toby, madam, your kinsman.OLIVIAFetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing butmadman: fie on him!Exit MARIAGo you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, Iam sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.Exit MALVOLIONow you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, andpeople dislike it.ClownThou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldestson should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram withbrains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has amost weak pia mater.Enter SIR TOBY BELCHOLIVIABy mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?SIR TOBY BELCHA gentleman.OLIVIAA gentleman! what gentleman?SIR TOBY BELCH'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' thesepickle-herring! How now, sot!ClownGood Sir Toby!OLIVIACousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?SIR TOBY BELCHLechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.OLIVIAAy, marry, what is he?SIR TOBY BELCHLet him be the devil, an he will, I care not: giveme faith, say I. Well, it's all one.ExitOLIVIAWhat's a drunken man like, fool?ClownLike a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: onedraught above heat makes him a fool; the second madshim; and a third drowns him.OLIVIAGo thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' mycoz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he'sdrowned: go, look after him.ClownHe is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall lookto the madman.ExitRe-enter MALVOLIOMALVOLIOMadam, yond young fellow swears he will speak withyou. I told him you were sick; he takes on him tounderstand so much, and therefore comes to speakwith you. I told him you were asleep; he seems tohave a foreknowledge of that too, and thereforecomes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,lady? he's fortified against any denial.OLIVIATell him he shall not speak with me.MALVOLIOHas been told so; and he says, he'll stand at yourdoor like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter toa bench, but he'll speak with you.OLIVIAWhat kind o' man is he?MALVOLIOWhy, of mankind.OLIVIAWhat manner of man?MALVOLIOOf very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.OLIVIAOf what personage and years is he?MALVOLIONot yet old enough for a man, nor young enough fora boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or acooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with himin standing water, between boy and man. He is verywell-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; onewould think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.OLIVIALet him approach: call in my gentlewoman.MALVOLIOGentlewoman, my lady calls.ExitRe-enter MARIAOLIVIAGive me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.Enter VIOLA, and AttendantsVIOLAThe honourable lady of the house, which is she?OLIVIASpeak to me; I shall answer for her.Your will?VIOLAMost radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--Ipray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast awaymy speech, for besides that it is excellently wellpenned, I have taken great pains to con it. Goodbeauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am verycomptible, even to the least sinister usage.OLIVIAWhence came you, sir?VIOLAI can say little more than I have studied, and thatquestion's out of my part. Good gentle one, give memodest assurance if you be the lady of the house,that I may proceed in my speech.OLIVIAAre you a comedian?VIOLANo, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangsof malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are youthe lady of the house?OLIVIAIf I do not usurp myself, I am.VIOLAMost certain, if you are she, you do usurpyourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yoursto reserve. But this is from my commission: I willon with my speech in your praise, and then show youthe heart of my message.OLIVIACome to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.VIOLAAlas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.OLIVIAIt is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,and allowed your approach rather to wonder at youthan to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; ifyou have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time ofmoon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.MARIAWill you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.VIOLANo, good swabber; I am to hull here a littlelonger. Some mollification for your giant, sweetlady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.OLIVIASure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, whenthe courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.VIOLAIt alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture ofwar, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in myhand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.OLIVIAYet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?VIOLAThe rudeness that hath appeared in me have Ilearned from my entertainment. What I am, and what Iwould, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,divinity, to any other's, profanation.OLIVIAGive us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.Exeunt MARIA and AttendantsNow, sir, what is your text?VIOLAMost sweet lady,--OLIVIAA comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.Where lies your text?VIOLAIn Orsino's bosom.OLIVIAIn his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?VIOLATo answer by the method, in the first of his heart.OLIVIAO, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?VIOLAGood madam, let me see your face.OLIVIAHave you any commission from your lord to negotiatewith my face? You are now out of your text: butwe will draw the curtain and show you the picture.Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is'tnot well done?UnveilingVIOLAExcellently done, if God did all.OLIVIA'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.VIOLA'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and whiteNature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,If you will lead these graces to the graveAnd leave the world no copy.OLIVIAO, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will giveout divers schedules of my beauty: it shall beinventoried, and every particle and utensillabelled to my will: as, item, two lips,indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids tothem; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Wereyou sent hither to praise me?VIOLAI see you what you are, you are too proud;But, if you were the devil, you are fair.My lord and master loves you: O, such loveCould be but recompensed, though you were crown'dThe nonpareil of beauty!OLIVIAHow does he love me?VIOLAWith adorations, fertile tears,With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.OLIVIAYour lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;And in dimension and the shape of natureA gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;He might have took his answer long ago.VIOLAIf I did love you in my master's flame,With such a suffering, such a deadly life,In your denial I would find no sense;I would not understand it.OLIVIAWhy, what would you?VIOLAMake me a willow cabin at your gate,And call upon my soul within the house;Write loyal cantons of contemned loveAnd sing them loud even in the dead of night;Halloo your name to the reverberate hillsAnd make the babbling gossip of the airCry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not restBetween the elements of air and earth,But you should pity me!OLIVIAYou might do much.What is your parentage?VIOLAAbove my fortunes, yet my state is well:I am a gentleman.OLIVIAGet you to your lord;I cannot love him: let him send no more;Unless, perchance, you come to me again,To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.VIOLAI am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:My master, not myself, lacks recompense.Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;And let your fervor, like my master's, bePlaced in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.ExitOLIVIA'What is your parentage?''Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:soft, soft!Unless the master were the man. How now!Even so quickly may one catch the plague?Methinks I feel this youth's perfectionsWith an invisible and subtle stealthTo creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.What ho, Malvolio!Re-enter MALVOLIOMALVOLIOHere, madam, at your service.OLIVIARun after that same peevish messenger,The county's man: he left this ring behind him,Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.Desire him not to flatter with his lord,Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.MALVOLIOMadam, I will.ExitOLIVIAI do I know not what, and fear to findMine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;What is decreed must be, and be this so.ExitACT IISCENE I. The sea-coast.Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIANANTONIOWill you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?SEBASTIANBy your patience, no. My stars shine darkly overme: the malignancy of my fate might perhapsdistemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you yourleave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a badrecompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.SEBASTIANNo, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mereextravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent atouch of modesty, that you will not extort from mewhat I am willing to keep in; therefore it chargesme in manners the rather to express myself. Youmust know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,which I called Roderigo. My father was thatSebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heardof. He left behind him myself and a sister, bothborn in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;for some hour before you took me from the breach ofthe sea was my sister drowned.ANTONIOAlas the day!SEBASTIANA lady, sir, though it was said she much resembledme, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,though I could not with such estimable wonderoverfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldlypublish her; she bore a mind that envy could not butcall fair. She is drowned already, sir, with saltwater, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.ANTONIOPardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.SEBASTIANO good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.ANTONIOIf you will not murder me for my love, let me beyour servant.SEBASTIANIf you will not undo what you have done, that is,kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, thatupon the least occasion more mine eyes will telltales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.ExitANTONIOThe gentleness of all the gods go with thee!I have many enemies in Orsino's court,Else would I very shortly see thee there.But, come what may, I do adore thee so,That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.ExitSCENE II. A street.Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO followingMALVOLIOWere not you even now with the Countess Olivia?VIOLAEven now, sir; on a moderate pace I have sincearrived but hither.MALVOLIOShe returns this ring to you, sir: you might havesaved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.She adds, moreover, that you should put your lordinto a desperate assurance she will none of him:and one thing more, that you be never so hardy tocome again in his affairs, unless it be to reportyour lord's taking of this. Receive it so.VIOLAShe took the ring of me: I'll none of it.MALVOLIOCome, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and herwill is, it should be so returned: if it be worthstooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, beit his that finds it.ExitVIOLAI left no ring with her: what means this lady?Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!She made good view of me; indeed, so much,That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,For she did speak in starts distractedly.She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passionInvites me in this churlish messenger.None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,Poor lady, she were better love a dream.Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.How easy is it for the proper-falseIn women's waxen hearts to set their forms!Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!For such as we are made of, such we be.How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.What will become of this?

Does not our life consist of thefour elements?SIR ANDREWFaith, so they say; but I think it rather consistsof eating and drinking.SIR TOBY BELCHThou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!Enter ClownSIR ANDREWHere comes the fool, i' faith.ClownHow now, my hearts! did you never see the pictureof 'we three'?SIR TOBY BELCHWelcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.SIR ANDREWBy my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. Ihad rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. Insooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling lastnight, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of theVapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twasvery good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thyleman: hadst it?ClownI did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's noseis no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and theMyrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.SIR ANDREWExcellent! why, this is the best fooling, when allis done. Now, a song.SIR TOBY BELCHCome on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.SIR ANDREWThere's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--ClownWould you have a love-song, or a song of good life?SIR TOBY BELCHA love-song, a love-song.SIR ANDREWAy, ay: I care not for good life.Clown[Sings]O mistress mine, where are you roaming?O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,That can sing both high and low:Trip no further, pretty sweeting;Journeys end in lovers meeting,Every wise man's son doth know.SIR ANDREWExcellent good, i' faith.SIR TOBY BELCHGood, good.Clown[Sings]What is love? 'tis not hereafter;Present mirth hath present laughter;What's to come is still unsure:In delay there lies no plenty;Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,Youth's a stuff will not endure.SIR ANDREWA mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.SIR TOBY BELCHA contagious breath.SIR ANDREWVery sweet and contagious, i' faith.SIR TOBY BELCHTo hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall werouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw threesouls out of one weaver? shall we do that?SIR ANDREWAn you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.ClownBy'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.SIR ANDREWMost certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'Clown'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall beconstrained in't to call thee knave, knight.SIR ANDREW'Tis not the first time I have constrained one tocall me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'ClownI shall never begin if I hold my peace.SIR ANDREWGood, i' faith. Come, begin.Catch sungEnter MARIAMARIAWhat a caterwauling do you keep here! If my ladyhave not called up her steward Malvolio and bid himturn you out of doors, never trust me.SIR TOBY BELCHMy lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio'sa Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.'

My lady bade metell you, that, though she harbours you as herkinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders.

For Monsieur Malvolio, let mealone with him: if I do not gull him into anayword, and make him a common recreation, do notthink I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:I know I can do it.SIR TOBY BELCHPossess us, possess us; tell us something of him.MARIAMarry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.SIR ANDREWO, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!SIR TOBY BELCHWhat, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,dear knight?SIR ANDREWI have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reasongood enough.MARIAThe devil a puritan that he is, or any thingconstantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,that cons state without book and utters it by greatswarths: the best persuaded of himself, socrammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it ishis grounds of faith that all that look on him lovehim; and on that vice in him will my revenge findnotable cause to work.SIR TOBY BELCHWhat wilt thou do?MARIAI will drop in his way some obscure epistles oflove; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shapeof his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressureof his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall findhimself most feelingly personated. I can write verylike my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter wecan hardly make distinction of our hands.SIR TOBY BELCHExcellent! I smell a device.SIR ANDREWI have't in my nose too.SIR TOBY BELCHHe shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,that they come from my niece, and that she's inlove with him.MARIAMy purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.SIR ANDREWAnd your horse now would make him an ass.MARIAAss, I doubt not.SIR ANDREWO, 'twill be admirable!MARIASport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic willwork with him.

Now, good morrow, friends.Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,That old and antique song we heard last night:Methought it did relieve my passion much,More than light airs and recollected termsOf these most brisk and giddy-paced times:Come, but one verse.CURIOHe is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.DUKE ORSINOWho was it?CURIOFeste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the ladyOlivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.DUKE ORSINOSeek him out, and play the tune the while.Exit CURIO. Music playsCome hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,In the sweet pangs of it remember me;For such as I am all true lovers are,Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,Save in the constant image of the creatureThat is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?VIOLAIt gives a very echo to the seatWhere Love is throned.DUKE ORSINOThou dost speak masterly:My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eyeHath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:Hath it not, boy?VIOLAA little, by your favour.DUKE ORSINOWhat kind of woman is't?VIOLAOf your complexion.DUKE ORSINOShe is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?VIOLAAbout your years, my lord.DUKE ORSINOToo old by heaven: let still the woman takeAn elder than herself: so wears she to him,So sways she level in her husband's heart:For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,Than women's are.VIOLAI think it well, my lord.DUKE ORSINOThen let thy love be younger than thyself,Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;For women are as roses, whose fair flowerBeing once display'd, doth fall that very hour.VIOLAAnd so they are: alas, that they are so;To die, even when they to perfection grow!Re-enter CURIO and ClownDUKE ORSINOO, fellow, come, the song we had last night.Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;The spinsters and the knitters in the sunAnd the free maids that weave their thread with bonesDo use to chant it: it is silly sooth,And dallies with the innocence of love,Like the old age.ClownAre you ready, sir?DUKE ORSINOAy; prithee, sing.MusicSONG.ClownCome away, come away, death,And in sad cypress let me be laid;Fly away, fly away breath;I am slain by a fair cruel maid.My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,O, prepare it!My part of death, no one so trueDid share it.Not a flower, not a flower sweetOn my black coffin let there be strown;Not a friend, not a friend greetMy poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:A thousand thousand sighs to save,Lay me, O, whereSad true lover never find my grave,To weep there!DUKE ORSINOThere's for thy pains.ClownNo pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.DUKE ORSINOI'll pay thy pleasure then.ClownTruly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.DUKE ORSINOGive me now leave to leave thee.ClownNow, the melancholy god protect thee; and thetailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, forthy mind is a very opal. I would have men of suchconstancy put to sea, that their business might beevery thing and their intent every where; for that'sit that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.ExitDUKE ORSINOLet all the rest give place.CURIO and Attendants retireOnce more, Cesario,Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;But 'tis that miracle and queen of gemsThat nature pranks her in attracts my soul.VIOLABut if she cannot love you, sir?DUKE ORSINOI cannot be so answer'd.VIOLASooth, but you must.Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,Hath for your love a great a pang of heartAs you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?DUKE ORSINOThere is no woman's sidesCan bide the beating of so strong a passionAs love doth give my heart; no woman's heartSo big, to hold so much; they lack retentionAlas, their love may be call'd appetite,No motion of the liver, but the palate,That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;But mine is all as hungry as the sea,And can digest as much: make no compareBetween that love a woman can bear meAnd that I owe Olivia.VIOLAAy, but I know--DUKE ORSINOWhat dost thou know?VIOLAToo well what love women to men may owe:In faith, they are as true of heart as we.My father had a daughter loved a man,As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,I should your lordship.DUKE ORSINOAnd what's her history?VIOLAA blank, my lord. She never told her love,But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,And with a green and yellow melancholyShe sat like patience on a monument,Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?We men may say more, swear more: but indeedOur shows are more than will; for still we proveMuch in our vows, but little in our love.DUKE ORSINOBut died thy sister of her love, my boy?VIOLAI am all the daughters of my father's house,And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.Sir, shall I to this lady?DUKE ORSINOAy, that's the theme.To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,My love can give no place, bide no denay.ExeuntSCENE V.

Why, she may commandme: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this isevident to any formal capacity; there is noobstruction in this: and the end,--what shouldthat alphabetical position portend?

Beopposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; letthy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself intothe trick of singularity: she thus advises theethat sighs for thee. Remember who commended thyyellow stockings, and wished to see thee evercross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou artmade, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me seethee a steward still, the fellow of servants, andnot worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.She that would alter services with thee,THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this isopen. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off grossacquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jademe; for every reason excites to this, that my ladyloves me. She did commend my yellow stockings oflate, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;and in this she manifests herself to my love, andwith a kind of injunction drives me to these habitsof her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I willbe strange, stout, in yellow stockings, andcross-gartered, even with the swiftness of puttingon. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet apostscript.Reads'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thouentertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;thy smiles become thee well; therefore in mypresence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will doeverything that thou wilt have me.ExitFABIANI will not give my part of this sport for a pensionof thousands to be paid from the Sophy.SIR TOBY BELCHI could marry this wench for this device.SIR ANDREWSo could I too.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.SIR ANDREWNor I neither.FABIANHere comes my noble gull-catcher.Re-enter MARIASIR TOBY BELCHWilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?SIR ANDREWOr o' mine either?SIR TOBY BELCHShall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thybond-slave?SIR ANDREWI' faith, or I either?SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, thou hast put him in such a dream, that whenthe image of it leaves him he must run mad.MARIANay, but say true; does it work upon him?SIR TOBY BELCHLike aqua-vitae with a midwife.MARIAIf you will then see the fruits of the sport, markhis first approach before my lady: he will come toher in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour sheabhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;and he will smile upon her, which will now be sounsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to amelancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn himinto a notable contempt. If you will see it, followme.SIR TOBY BELCHTo the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!SIR ANDREWI'll make one too.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabourVIOLASave thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live bythy tabour?ClownNo, sir, I live by the church.VIOLAArt thou a churchman?ClownNo such matter, sir: I do live by the church; forI do live at my house, and my house doth stand bythe church.VIOLASo thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if abeggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thytabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.ClownYou have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence isbut a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly thewrong side may be turned outward!VIOLANay, that's certain; they that dally nicely withwords may quickly make them wanton.ClownI would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.VIOLAWhy, man?ClownWhy, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with thatword might make my sister wanton. But indeed wordsare very rascals since bonds disgraced them.VIOLAThy reason, man?ClownTroth, sir, I can yield you none without words; andwords are grown so false, I am loath to provereason with them.VIOLAI warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.ClownNot so, sir, I do care for something; but in myconscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that beto care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.VIOLAArt not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?ClownNo, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: shewill keep no fool, sir, till she be married; andfools are as like husbands as pilchards are toherrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed nother fool, but her corrupter of words.VIOLAI saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.ClownFoolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, butthe fool should be as oft with your master as withmy mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.VIOLANay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.Hold, there's expenses for thee.ClownNow Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!VIOLABy my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick forone;Asidethough I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thylady within?ClownWould not a pair of these have bred, sir?VIOLAYes, being kept together and put to use.ClownI would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bringa Cressida to this Troilus.VIOLAI understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.ClownThe matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging buta beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady iswithin, sir. I will construe to them whence youcome; who you are and what you would are out of mywelkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.ExitVIOLAThis fellow is wise enough to play the fool;And to do that well craves a kind of wit:He must observe their mood on whom he jests,The quality of persons, and the time,And, like the haggard, cheque at every featherThat comes before his eye. This is a practiseAs full of labour as a wise man's artFor folly that he wisely shows is fit;But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREWSIR TOBY BELCHSave you, gentleman.VIOLAAnd you, sir.SIR ANDREWDieu vous garde, monsieur.VIOLAEt vous aussi; votre serviteur.SIR ANDREWI hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.SIR TOBY BELCHWill you encounter the house? my niece is desirousyou should enter, if your trade be to her.VIOLAI am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is thelist of my voyage.SIR TOBY BELCHTaste your legs, sir; put them to motion.VIOLAMy legs do better understand me, sir, than Iunderstand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.SIR TOBY BELCHI mean, to go, sir, to enter.VIOLAI will answer you with gait and entrance.

I did send,After the last enchantment you did here,A ring in chase of you: so did I abuseMyself, my servant and, I fear me, you:Under your hard construction must I sit,To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?Have you not set mine honour at the stakeAnd baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughtsThat tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receivingEnough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.VIOLAI pity you.OLIVIAThat's a degree to love.VIOLANo, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,That very oft we pity enemies.OLIVIAWhy, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!If one should be a prey, how much the betterTo fall before the lion than the wolf!Clock strikesThe clock upbraids me with the waste of time.Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,Your were is alike to reap a proper man:There lies your way, due west.VIOLAThen westward-ho! Grace and good dispositionAttend your ladyship!You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?OLIVIAStay:I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.VIOLAThat you do think you are not what you are.OLIVIAIf I think so, I think the same of you.VIOLAThen think you right: I am not what I am.OLIVIAI would you were as I would have you be!VIOLAWould it be better, madam, than I am?I wish it might, for now I am your fool.OLIVIAO, what a deal of scorn looks beautifulIn the contempt and anger of his lip!A murderous guilt shows not itself more soonThan love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.Cesario, by the roses of the spring,By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,But rather reason thus with reason fetter,Love sought is good, but given unsought better.VIOLABy innocence I swear, and by my youthI have one heart, one bosom and one truth,And that no woman has; nor never noneShall mistress be of it, save I alone.And so adieu, good madam: never moreWill I my master's tears to you deplore.OLIVIAYet come again; for thou perhaps mayst moveThat heart, which now abhors, to like his love.ExeuntSCENE II. OLIVIA's house.Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIANSIR ANDREWNo, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.SIR TOBY BELCHThy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.FABIANYou must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.SIR ANDREWMarry, I saw your niece do more favours to thecount's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;I saw't i' the orchard.SIR TOBY BELCHDid she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.SIR ANDREWAs plain as I see you now.FABIANThis was a great argument of love in her toward you.SIR ANDREW'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?FABIANI will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths ofjudgment and reason.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd they have been grand-jury-men since before Noahwas a sailor.FABIANShe did show favour to the youth in your sight onlyto exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, toput fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.You should then have accosted her; and with someexcellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you shouldhave banged the youth into dumbness. This waslooked for at your hand, and this was balked: thedouble gilt of this opportunity you let time washoff, and you are now sailed into the north of mylady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicleon a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it bysome laudable attempt either of valour or policy.SIR ANDREWAn't be any way, it must be with valour; for policyI hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as apolitician.SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis ofvalour. Challenge me the count's youth to fightwith him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shalltake note of it; and assure thyself, there is nolove-broker in the world can more prevail in man'scommendation with woman than report of valour.FABIANThere is no way but this, Sir Andrew.SIR ANDREWWill either of you bear me a challenge to him?SIR TOBY BELCHGo, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and funof invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not beamiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet ofpaper, although the sheet were big enough for thebed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thouwrite with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.SIR ANDREWWhere shall I find you?SIR TOBY BELCHWe'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.Exit SIR ANDREWFABIANThis is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.SIR TOBY BELCHI have been dear to him, lad, some two thousandstrong, or so.FABIANWe shall have a rare letter from him: but you'llnot deliver't?SIR TOBY BELCHNever trust me, then; and by all means stir on theyouth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropescannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he wereopened, and you find so much blood in his liver aswill clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest ofthe anatomy.FABIANAnd his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage nogreat presage of cruelty.Enter MARIASIR TOBY BELCHLook, where the youngest wren of nine comes.MARIAIf you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselfinto stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio isturned heathen, a very renegado; for there is noChristian, that means to be saved by believingrightly, can ever believe such impossible passagesof grossness. He's in yellow stockings.SIR TOBY BELCHAnd cross-gartered?MARIAMost villanously; like a pedant that keeps a schooli' the church. I have dogged him, like hismurderer. He does obey every point of the letterthat I dropped to betray him: he does smile hisface into more lines than is in the new map with theaugmentation of the Indies: you have not seen sucha thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling thingsat him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,he'll smile and take't for a great favour.SIR TOBY BELCHCome, bring us, bring us where he is.ExeuntSCENE III. A street.Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIOSEBASTIANI would not by my will have troubled you;But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,I will no further chide you.ANTONIOI could not stay behind you: my desire,More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;And not all love to see you, though so muchAs might have drawn one to a longer voyage,But jealousy what might befall your travel,Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,Unguided and unfriended, often proveRough and unhospitable: my willing love,The rather by these arguments of fear,Set forth in your pursuit.SEBASTIANMy kind Antonio,I can no other answer make but thanks,And thanks; and ever [         ] oft good turnsAre shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,You should find better dealing. What's to do?Shall we go see the reliques of this town?ANTONIOTo-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.SEBASTIANI am not weary, and 'tis long to night:I pray you, let us satisfy our eyesWith the memorials and the things of fameThat do renown this city.ANTONIOWould you'ld pardon me;I do not without danger walk these streets:Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleysI did some service; of such note indeed,That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.SEBASTIANBelike you slew great number of his people.ANTONIOThe offence is not of such a bloody nature;Albeit the quality of the time and quarrelMight well have given us bloody argument.It might have since been answer'd in repayingWhat we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,Most of our city did: only myself stood out;For which, if I be lapsed in this place,I shall pay dear.SEBASTIANDo not then walk too open.ANTONIOIt doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledgeWith viewing of the town: there shall you have me.SEBASTIANWhy I your purse?ANTONIOHaply your eye shall light upon some toyYou have desire to purchase; and your store,I think, is not for idle markets, sir.SEBASTIANI'll be your purse-bearer and leave youFor an hour.ANTONIOTo the Elephant.SEBASTIANI do remember.ExeuntSCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.Enter OLIVIA and MARIAOLIVIAI have sent after him: he says he'll come;How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.I speak too loud.Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:Where is Malvolio?MARIAHe's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. Heis, sure, possessed, madam.OLIVIAWhy, what's the matter? does he rave?MARIANo. madam, he does nothing but smile: yourladyship were best to have some guard about you, ifhe come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.OLIVIAGo call him hither.Exit MARIAI am as mad as he,If sad and merry madness equal be.Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIOHow now, Malvolio!MALVOLIOSweet lady, ho, ho.OLIVIASmilest thou?I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.MALVOLIOSad, lady! I could be sad: this does make someobstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; butwhat of that? if it please the eye of one, it iswith me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, andplease all.'OLIVIAWhy, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?MALVOLIONot black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. Itdid come to his hands, and commands shall beexecuted: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.OLIVIAWilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?MALVOLIOTo bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.OLIVIAGod comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kissthy hand so oft?MARIAHow do you, Malvolio?MALVOLIOAt your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.MARIAWhy appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?MALVOLIO'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.OLIVIAWhat meanest thou by that, Malvolio?MALVOLIO'Some are born great,'--OLIVIAHa!MALVOLIO'Some achieve greatness,'--OLIVIAWhat sayest thou?MALVOLIO'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'OLIVIAHeaven restore thee!MALVOLIO'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--OLIVIAThy yellow stockings!MALVOLIO'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'OLIVIACross-gartered!MALVOLIO'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--OLIVIAAm I made?MALVOLIO'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'OLIVIAWhy, this is very midsummer madness.Enter ServantServantMadam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's isreturned: I could hardly entreat him back: heattends your ladyship's pleasure.OLIVIAI'll come to him.Exit ServantGood Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where'smy cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a specialcare of him: I would not have him miscarry for thehalf of my dowry.Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIAMALVOLIOO, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man thanSir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly withthe letter: she sends him on purpose, that I mayappear stubborn to him; for she incites me to thatin the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; putthyself into the trick of singularity;' andconsequently sets down the manner how; as, a sadface, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in thehabit of some sir of note, and so forth. I havelimed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make methankful! And when she went away now, 'Let thisfellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, norafter my degree, but fellow. Why, every thingadheres together, that no dram of a scruple, noscruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulousor unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothingthat can be can come between me and the fullprospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is thedoer of this, and he is to be thanked.Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIANSIR TOBY BELCHWhich way is he, in the name of sanctity? If allthe devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legionhimself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.FABIANHere he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?how is't with you, man?MALVOLIOGo off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: gooff.MARIALo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did notI tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have acare of him.MALVOLIOAh, ha! does she so?SIR TOBY BELCHGo to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gentlywith him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? howis't with you? What, man! defy the devil:consider, he's an enemy to mankind.MALVOLIODo you know what you say?MARIALa you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takesit at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!FABIANCarry his water to the wise woman.MARIAMarry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if Ilive. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.MALVOLIOHow now, mistress!MARIAO Lord!SIR TOBY BELCHPrithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: doyou not see you move him? let me alone with him.FABIANNo way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend isrough, and will not be roughly used.SIR TOBY BELCHWhy, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?MALVOLIOSir!SIR TOBY BELCHAy, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not forgravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hanghim, foul collier!MARIAGet him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.MALVOLIOMy prayers, minx!MARIANo, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.MALVOLIOGo, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallowthings: I am not of your element: you shall knowmore hereafter.ExitSIR TOBY BELCHIs't possible?FABIANIf this were played upon a stage now, I couldcondemn it as an improbable fiction.SIR TOBY BELCHHis very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.MARIANay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.FABIANWhy, we shall make him mad indeed.MARIAThe house will be the quieter.SIR TOBY BELCHCome, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. Myniece is already in the belief that he's mad: wemay carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,till our very pastime, tired out of breath, promptus to have mercy on him: at which time we willbring the device to the bar and crown thee for afinder of madmen. But see, but see.Enter SIR ANDREWFABIANMore matter for a May morning.SIR ANDREWHere's the challenge, read it: warrant there'svinegar and pepper in't.FABIANIs't so saucy?SIR ANDREWAy, is't, I warrant him: do but read.SIR TOBY BELCHGive me.Reads'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'FABIANGood, and valiant.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads]  'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'FABIANA good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads]  'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in mysight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thythroat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'FABIANVery brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads]  'I will waylay thee going home; where if itbe thy chance to kill me,'--FABIANGood.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads]  'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'FABIANStill you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.SIR TOBY BELCH[Reads]  'Fare thee well; and God have mercy uponone of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; butmy hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thyfriend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,ANDREW AGUECHEEK.If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:I'll give't him.MARIAYou may have very fit occasion for't: he is now insome commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.SIR TOBY BELCHGo, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner theorchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seesthim, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; forit comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with aswaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhoodmore approbation than ever proof itself would haveearned him. Away!SIR ANDREWNay, let me alone for swearing.ExitSIR TOBY BELCHNow will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviorof the young gentleman gives him out to be of goodcapacity and breeding; his employment between hislord and my niece confirms no less: therefore thisletter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed noterror in the youth: he will find it comes from aclodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge byword of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable reportof valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know hisyouth will aptly receive it, into a most hideousopinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.This will so fright them both that they will killone another by the look, like cockatrices.Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLAFABIANHere he comes with your niece: give them way tillhe take leave, and presently after him.SIR TOBY BELCHI will meditate the while upon some horrid messagefor a challenge.Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIAOLIVIAI have said too much unto a heart of stoneAnd laid mine honour too unchary out:There's something in me that reproves my fault;But such a headstrong potent fault it is,That it but mocks reproof.VIOLAWith the same 'havior that your passion bearsGoes on my master's grief.OLIVIAHere, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;And I beseech you come again to-morrow.What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,That honour saved may upon asking give?VIOLANothing but this; your true love for my master.OLIVIAHow with mine honour may I give him thatWhich I have given to you?VIOLAI will acquit you.OLIVIAWell, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.ExitRe-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIANSIR TOBY BELCHGentleman, God save thee.VIOLAAnd you, sir.SIR TOBY BELCHThat defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of whatnature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I knownot; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody asthe hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, forthy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.VIOLAYou mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrelto me: my remembrance is very free and clear fromany image of offence done to any man.SIR TOBY BELCHYou'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,if you hold your life at any price, betake you toyour guard; for your opposite hath in him whatyouth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.VIOLAI pray you, sir, what is he?SIR TOBY BELCHHe is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and oncarpet consideration; but he is a devil in privatebrawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; andhis incensement at this moment is so implacable,that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of deathand sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.VIOLAI will return again into the house and desire someconduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heardof some kind of men that put quarrels purposely onothers, to taste their valour: belike this is a manof that quirk.SIR TOBY BELCHSir, no; his indignation derives itself out of avery competent injury: therefore, get you on andgive him his desire. Back you shall not to thehouse, unless you undertake that with me which withas much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle youmust, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.VIOLAThis is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do methis courteous office, as to know of the knight whatmy offence to him is: it is something of mynegligence, nothing of my purpose.SIR TOBY BELCHI will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by thisgentleman till my return.ExitVIOLAPray you, sir, do you know of this matter?FABIANI know the knight is incensed against you, even to amortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.VIOLAI beseech you, what manner of man is he?FABIANNothing of that wonderful promise, to read him byhis form, as you are like to find him in the proofof his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,bloody and fatal opposite that you could possiblyhave found in any part of Illyria. Will you walktowards him? I will make your peace with him if Ican.VIOLAI shall be much bound to you for't: I am one thathad rather go with sir priest than sir knight: Icare not who knows so much of my mettle.ExeuntRe-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREWSIR TOBY BELCHWhy, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such afirago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard andall, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortalmotion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, hepays you as surely as your feet hit the ground theystep on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.SIR ANDREWPox on't, I'll not meddle with him.SIR TOBY BELCHAy, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian canscarce hold him yonder.SIR ANDREWPlague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and socunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ldhave challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.SIR TOBY BELCHI'll make the motion: stand here, make a good showon't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.AsideMarry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLATo FABIANI have his horse to take up the quarrel:I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.FABIANHe is as horribly conceited of him; and pants andlooks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.SIR TOBY BELCH[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy, sir; he will fightwith you for's oath sake: marry, he hath betterbethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that nowscarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, forthe supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.VIOLA[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing wouldmake me tell them how much I lack of a man.FABIANGive ground, if you see him furious.SIR TOBY BELCHCome, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentlemanwill, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he haspromised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, hewill not hurt you. Come on; to't.SIR ANDREWPray God, he keep his oath!VIOLAI do assure you, 'tis against my will.They drawEnter ANTONIOANTONIOPut up your sword. If this young gentlemanHave done offence, I take the fault on me:If you offend him, I for him defy you.SIR TOBY BELCHYou, sir! why, what are you?ANTONIOOne, sir, that for his love dares yet do moreThan you have heard him brag to you he will.SIR TOBY BELCHNay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.They drawEnter OfficersFABIANO good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.SIR TOBY BELCHI'll be with you anon.VIOLAPray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.SIR ANDREWMarry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easilyand reins well.First OfficerThis is the man; do thy office.Second OfficerAntonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.ANTONIOYou do mistake me, sir.First OfficerNo, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.Take him away: he knows I know him well.ANTONIOI must obey.To VIOLAThis comes with seeking you:But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.What will you do, now my necessityMakes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves meMuch more for what I cannot do for youThan what befalls myself. You stand amazed;But be of comfort.Second OfficerCome, sir, away.ANTONIOI must entreat of you some of that money.VIOLAWhat money, sir?For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,Out of my lean and low abilityI'll lend you something: my having is not much;I'll make division of my present with you:Hold, there's half my coffer.ANTONIOWill you deny me now?Is't possible that my deserts to youCan lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,Lest that it make me so unsound a manAs to upbraid you with those kindnessesThat I have done for you.VIOLAI know of none;Nor know I you by voice or any feature:I hate ingratitude more in a manThan lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,Or any taint of vice whose strong corruptionInhabits our frail blood.ANTONIOO heavens themselves!Second OfficerCome, sir, I pray you, go.ANTONIOLet me speak a little. This youth that you see hereI snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,Relieved him with such sanctity of love,And to his image, which methought did promiseMost venerable worth, did I devotion.First OfficerWhat's that to us? The time goes by: away!ANTONIOBut O how vile an idol proves this godThou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.In nature there's no blemish but the mind;None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evilAre empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.First OfficerThe man grows mad: away with him!

Where's Antonio, then?I could not find him at the Elephant:Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,That he did range the town to seek me out.His counsel now might do me golden service;For though my soul disputes well with my sense,That this may be some error, but no madness,Yet doth this accident and flood of fortuneSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,That I am ready to distrust mine eyesAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades meTo any other trust but that I am madOr else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,She could not sway her house, command her followers,Take and give back affairs and their dispatchWith such a smooth, discreet and stable bearingAs I perceive she does: there's something in'tThat is deceiveable.

What's the matter?First OfficerOrsino, this is that AntonioThat took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;And this is he that did the Tiger board,When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,In private brabble did we apprehend him.VIOLAHe did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:I know not what 'twas but distraction.DUKE ORSINONotable pirate! thou salt-water thief!What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,Hast made thine enemies?ANTONIOOrsino, noble sir,Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,Though I confess, on base and ground enough,Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:That most ingrateful boy there by your side,From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouthDid I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:His life I gave him and did thereto addMy love, without retention or restraint,All his in dedication; for his sakeDid I expose myself, pure for his love,Into the danger of this adverse town;Drew to defend him when he was beset:Where being apprehended, his false cunning,Not meaning to partake with me in danger,Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,And grew a twenty years removed thingWhile one would wink; denied me mine own purse,Which I had recommended to his useNot half an hour before.VIOLAHow can this be?DUKE ORSINOWhen came he to this town?ANTONIOTo-day, my lord; and for three months before,No interim, not a minute's vacancy,Both day and night did we keep company.Enter OLIVIA and AttendantsDUKE ORSINOHere comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:Three months this youth hath tended upon me;But more of that anon.

What shall I do?OLIVIAEven what it please my lord, that shall become him.DUKE ORSINOWhy should I not, had I the heart to do it,Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,Kill what I love?--a savage jealousyThat sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,And that I partly know the instrumentThat screws me from my true place in your favour,Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;But this your minion, whom I know you love,And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,To spite a raven's heart within a dove.VIOLAAnd I, most jocund, apt and willingly,To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.OLIVIAWhere goes Cesario?VIOLAAfter him I loveMore than I love these eyes, more than my life,More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.If I do feign, you witnesses abovePunish my life for tainting of my love!OLIVIAAy me, detested! how am I beguiled!VIOLAWho does beguile you? who does do you wrong?OLIVIAHast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?Call forth the holy father.DUKE ORSINOCome, away!OLIVIAWhither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.DUKE ORSINOHusband!OLIVIAAy, husband: can he that deny?DUKE ORSINOHer husband, sirrah!VIOLANo, my lord, not I.OLIVIAAlas, it is the baseness of thy fearThat makes thee strangle thy propriety:Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou artAs great as that thou fear'st.Enter PriestO, welcome, father!Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,Here to unfold, though lately we intendedTo keep in darkness what occasion nowReveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost knowHath newly pass'd between this youth and me.PriestA contract of eternal bond of love,Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,Attested by the holy close of lips,Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;And all the ceremony of this compactSeal'd in my function, by my testimony:Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my graveI have travell'd but two hours.DUKE ORSINOO thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou beWhen time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feetWhere thou and I henceforth may never meet.VIOLAMy lord, I do protest--OLIVIAO, do not swear!Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.Enter SIR ANDREWSIR ANDREWFor the love of God, a surgeon!

Which is Sebastian?OLIVIAMost wonderful!SEBASTIANDo I stand there? I never had a brother;Nor can there be that deity in my nature,Of here and every where. I had a sister,Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.Of charity, what kin are you to me?What countryman? what name? what parentage?VIOLAOf Messaline: Sebastian was my father;Such a Sebastian was my brother too,So went he suited to his watery tomb:If spirits can assume both form and suitYou come to fright us.SEBASTIANA spirit I am indeed;But am in that dimension grossly cladWhich from the womb I did participate.Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'VIOLAMy father had a mole upon his brow.SEBASTIANAnd so had mine.VIOLAAnd died that day when Viola from her birthHad number'd thirteen years.SEBASTIANO, that record is lively in my soul!He finished indeed his mortal actThat day that made my sister thirteen years.VIOLAIf nothing lets to make us happy bothBut this my masculine usurp'd attire,Do not embrace me till each circumstanceOf place, time, fortune, do cohere and jumpThat I am Viola: which to confirm,I'll bring you to a captain in this town,Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle helpI was preserved to serve this noble count.All the occurrence of my fortune sinceHath been between this lady and this lord.SEBASTIAN[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:But nature to her bias drew in that.You would have been contracted to a maid;Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.DUKE ORSINOBe not amazed; right noble is his blood.If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,I shall have share in this most happy wreck.To VIOLABoy, thou hast said to me a thousand timesThou never shouldst love woman like to me.VIOLAAnd all those sayings will I overswear;And those swearings keep as true in soulAs doth that orbed continent the fireThat severs day from night.DUKE ORSINOGive me thy hand;And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.VIOLAThe captain that did bring me first on shoreHath my maid's garments: he upon some actionIs now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.OLIVIAHe shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:And yet, alas, now I remember me,They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIANA most extracting frenzy of mine ownFrom my remembrance clearly banish'd his.How does he, sirrah?ClownTruly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end aswell as a man in his case may do: has here writ aletter to you; I should have given't you to-daymorning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,so it skills not much when they are delivered.OLIVIAOpen't, and read it.ClownLook then to be well edified when the fool deliversthe madman.Reads'By the Lord, madam,'--OLIVIAHow now! art thou mad?ClownNo, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyshipwill have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.OLIVIAPrithee, read i' thy right wits.ClownSo I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is toread thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.OLIVIARead it you, sirrah.To FABIANFABIAN[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and theworld shall know it: though you have put me intodarkness and given your drunken cousin rule overme, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well asyour ladyship. I have your own letter that inducedme to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubtnot but to do myself much right, or you much shame.Think of me as you please.

Pray you, peruse that letter.You must not now deny it is your hand:Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:You can say none of this: well, grant it thenAnd tell me, in the modesty of honour,Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,To put on yellow stockings and to frownUpon Sir Toby and the lighter people;And, acting this in an obedient hope,Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,And made the most notorious geck and gullThat e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.OLIVIAAlas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,Though, I confess, much like the characterBut out of question 'tis Maria's hand.And now I do bethink me, it was sheFirst told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,And in such forms which here were presupposedUpon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;But when we know the grounds and authors of it,Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judgeOf thine own cause.FABIANGood madam, hear me speak,And let no quarrel nor no brawl to comeTaint the condition of this present hour,Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,Most freely I confess, myself and TobySet this device against Malvolio here,Upon some stubborn and uncourteous partsWe had conceived against him: Maria writThe letter at Sir Toby's great importance;In recompense whereof he hath married her.How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;If that the injuries be justly weigh'dThat have on both sides pass'd.OLIVIAAlas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!ClownWhy, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I wasone, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; butthat's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at sucha barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.MALVOLIOI'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.ExitOLIVIAHe hath been most notoriously abused.DUKE ORSINOPursue him and entreat him to a peace:He hath not told us of the captain yet:When that is known and golden time convents,A solemn combination shall be madeOf our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;For so you shall be, while you are a man;But when in other habits you are seen,Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.Exeunt all, except ClownClown[Sings]When that I was and a little tiny boy,With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,A foolish thing was but a toy,For the rain it raineth every day.But when I came to man's estate,With hey, ho,  & c.'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,For the rain,  & c.But when I came, alas! to wive,With hey, ho,  & c.By swaggering could I never thrive,For the rain,  & c.But when I came unto my beds,With hey, ho,  & c.With toss-pots still had drunken heads,For the rain,  & c.A great while ago the world begun,With hey, ho,  & c.But that's all one, our play is done,And we'll strive to please you every day.Exit
