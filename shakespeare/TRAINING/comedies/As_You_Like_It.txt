ACT ISCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.Enter ORLANDO and ADAMORLANDOAs I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashionbequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on hisblessing, to breed me well: and there begins mysadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, andreport speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak moreproperly, stays me here at home unkept; for call youthat keeping for a gentleman of my birth, thatdiffers not from the stalling of an ox? His horsesare bred better; for, besides that they are fairwith their feeding, they are taught their manage,and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, hisbrother, gain nothing under him but growth; for thewhich his animals on his dunghills are as muchbound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he soplentifully gives me, the something that nature gaveme his countenance seems to take from me: he letsme feed with his hinds, bars me the place of abrother, and, as much as in him lies, mines mygentility with my education. This is it, Adam, thatgrieves me; and the spirit of my father, which Ithink is within me, begins to mutiny against thisservitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet Iknow no wise remedy how to avoid it.ADAMYonder comes my master, your brother.ORLANDOGo apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he willshake me up.Enter OLIVEROLIVERNow, sir! what make you here?ORLANDONothing: I am not taught to make any thing.OLIVERWhat mar you then, sir?ORLANDOMarry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which Godmade, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.OLIVERMarry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.ORLANDOShall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?What prodigal portion have I spent, that I shouldcome to such penury?OLIVERKnow you where your are, sir?ORLANDOO, sir, very well; here in your orchard.OLIVERKnow you before whom, sir?ORLANDOAy, better than him I am before knows me. I knowyou are my eldest brother; and, in the gentlecondition of blood, you should so know me. Thecourtesy of nations allows you my better, in thatyou are the first-born; but the same traditiontakes not away my blood, were there twenty brothersbetwixt us: I have as much of my father in me asyou; albeit, I confess, your coming before me isnearer to his reverence.OLIVERWhat, boy!ORLANDOCome, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.OLIVERWilt thou lay hands on me, villain?ORLANDOI am no villain; I am the youngest son of SirRowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thricea villain that says such a father begot villains.Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this handfrom thy throat till this other had pulled out thytongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.ADAMSweet masters, be patient: for your father'sremembrance, be at accord.OLIVERLet me go, I say.ORLANDOI will not, till I please: you shall hear me. Myfather charged you in his will to give me goodeducation: you have trained me like a peasant,obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-likequalities. The spirit of my father grows strong inme, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allowme such exercises as may become a gentleman, orgive me the poor allottery my father left me bytestament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.OLIVERAnd what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubledwith you; you shall have some part of your will: Ipray you, leave me.ORLANDOI will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.OLIVERGet you with him, you old dog.ADAMIs 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost myteeth in your service. God be with my old master!he would not have spoke such a word.Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAMOLIVERIs it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I willphysic your rankness, and yet give no thousandcrowns neither. Holla, Dennis!Enter DENNISDENNISCalls your worship?OLIVERWas not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?DENNISSo please you, he is here at the door and importunesaccess to you.OLIVERCall him in.Exit DENNIS'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.Enter CHARLESCHARLESGood morrow to your worship.OLIVERGood Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at thenew court?CHARLESThere's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:that is, the old duke is banished by his youngerbrother the new duke; and three or four loving lordshave put themselves into voluntary exile with him,whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;therefore he gives them good leave to wander.OLIVERCan you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, bebanished with her father?CHARLESO, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so lovesher, being ever from their cradles bred together,that she would have followed her exile, or have diedto stay behind her. She is at the court, and noless beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; andnever two ladies loved as they do.OLIVERWhere will the old duke live?CHARLESThey say he is already in the forest of Arden, anda many merry men with him; and there they live likethe old Robin Hood of England: they say many younggentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the timecarelessly, as they did in the golden world.OLIVERWhat, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?CHARLESMarry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with amatter. I am given, sir, secretly to understandthat your younger brother Orlando hath a dispositionto come in disguised against me to try a fall.To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he thatescapes me without some broken limb shall acquit himwell. Your brother is but young and tender; and,for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as Imust, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint youwithal, that either you might stay him from hisintendment or brook such disgrace well as he shallrun into, in that it is a thing of his own searchand altogether against my will.OLIVERCharles, I thank thee for thy love to me, whichthou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I hadmyself notice of my brother's purpose herein andhave by underhand means laboured to dissuade him fromit, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, fullof ambition, an envious emulator of every man'sgood parts, a secret and villanous contriver againstme his natural brother: therefore use thydiscretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neckas his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for ifthou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do notmightily grace himself on thee, he will practiseagainst thee by poison, entrap thee by sometreacherous device and never leave thee till hehath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speakit, there is not one so young and so villanous thisday living. I speak but brotherly of him; butshould I anatomize him to thee as he is, I mustblush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.CHARLESI am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he cometo-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he goalone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: andso God keep your worship!OLIVERFarewell, good Charles.Exit CHARLESNow will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall seean end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, neverschooled and yet learned, full of noble device, ofall sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so muchin the heart of the world, and especially of my ownpeople, who best know him, that I am altogethermisprised: but it shall not be so long; thiswrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but thatI kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.ExitSCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.Enter CELIA and ROSALINDCELIAI pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.ROSALINDDear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you couldteach me to forget a banished father, you must notlearn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.CELIAHerein I see thou lovest me not with the full weightthat I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thouhadst been still with me, I could have taught mylove to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,if the truth of thy love to me were so righteouslytempered as mine is to thee.ROSALINDWell, I will forget the condition of my estate, torejoice in yours.CELIAYou know my father hath no child but I, nor none islike to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shaltbe his heir, for what he hath taken away from thyfather perforce, I will render thee again inaffection; by mine honour, I will; and when I breakthat oath, let me turn monster: therefore, mysweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.ROSALINDFrom henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Letme see; what think you of falling in love?CELIAMarry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: butlove no man in good earnest; nor no further in sportneither than with safety of a pure blush thou maystin honour come off again.ROSALINDWhat shall be our sport, then?CELIALet us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune fromher wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.ROSALINDI would we could do so, for her benefits aremightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind womandoth most mistake in her gifts to women.CELIA'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarcemakes honest, and those that she makes honest shemakes very ill-favouredly.ROSALINDNay, now thou goest from Fortune's office toNature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,not in the lineaments of Nature.Enter TOUCHSTONECELIANo? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may shenot by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Naturehath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath notFortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?ROSALINDIndeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, whenFortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off ofNature's wit.CELIAPeradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, butNature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dullto reason of such goddesses and hath sent thisnatural for our whetstone; for always the dulness ofthe fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,wit! whither wander you?TOUCHSTONEMistress, you must come away to your father.CELIAWere you made the messenger?TOUCHSTONENo, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.ROSALINDWhere learned you that oath, fool?TOUCHSTONEOf a certain knight that swore by his honour theywere good pancakes and swore by his honour themustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, thepancakes were naught and the mustard was good, andyet was not the knight forsworn.CELIAHow prove you that, in the great heap of yourknowledge?ROSALINDAy, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.TOUCHSTONEStand you both forth now: stroke your chins, andswear by your beards that I am a knave.CELIABy our beards, if we had them, thou art.TOUCHSTONEBy my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if youswear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: nomore was this knight swearing by his honour, for henever had any; or if he had, he had sworn it awaybefore ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.CELIAPrithee, who is't that thou meanest?TOUCHSTONEOne that old Frederick, your father, loves.CELIAMy father's love is enough to honour him: enough!speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxationone of these days.TOUCHSTONEThe more pity, that fools may not speak wisely whatwise men do foolishly.CELIABy my troth, thou sayest true; for since the littlewit that fools have was silenced, the little foolerythat wise men have makes a great show. Here comesMonsieur Le Beau.ROSALINDWith his mouth full of news.CELIAWhich he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.ROSALINDThen shall we be news-crammed.CELIAAll the better; we shall be the more marketable.Enter LE BEAUBon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?LE BEAUFair princess, you have lost much good sport.CELIASport! of what colour?LE BEAUWhat colour, madam! how shall I answer you?ROSALINDAs wit and fortune will.TOUCHSTONEOr as the Destinies decree.CELIAWell said: that was laid on with a trowel.TOUCHSTONENay, if I keep not my rank,--ROSALINDThou losest thy old smell.LE BEAUYou amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of goodwrestling, which you have lost the sight of.ROSALINDYou tell us the manner of the wrestling.LE BEAUI will tell you the beginning; and, if it pleaseyour ladyships, you may see the end; for the best isyet to do; and here, where you are, they are comingto perform it.CELIAWell, the beginning, that is dead and buried.LE BEAUThere comes an old man and his three sons,--CELIAI could match this beginning with an old tale.LE BEAUThree proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.ROSALINDWith bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all menby these presents.'LE BEAUThe eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, theduke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw himand broke three of his ribs, that there is littlehope of life in him: so he served the second, andso the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,their father, making such pitiful dole over themthat all the beholders take his part with weeping.ROSALINDAlas!TOUCHSTONEBut what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladieshave lost?LE BEAUWhy, this that I speak of.TOUCHSTONEThus men may grow wiser every day: it is the firsttime that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sportfor ladies.CELIAOr I, I promise thee.ROSALINDBut is there any else longs to see this broken musicin his sides? is there yet another dotes uponrib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?LE BEAUYou must, if you stay here; for here is the placeappointed for the wrestling, and they are ready toperform it.CELIAYonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and AttendantsDUKE FREDERICKCome on: since the youth will not be entreated, hisown peril on his forwardness.ROSALINDIs yonder the man?LE BEAUEven he, madam.CELIAAlas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.DUKE FREDERICKHow now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hitherto see the wrestling?ROSALINDAy, my liege, so please you give us leave.DUKE FREDERICKYou will take little delight in it, I can tell you;there is such odds in the man. In pity of thechallenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but hewill not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see ifyou can move him.CELIACall him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.DUKE FREDERICKDo so: I'll not be by.LE BEAUMonsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.ORLANDOI attend them with all respect and duty.ROSALINDYoung man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?ORLANDONo, fair princess; he is the general challenger: Icome but in, as others do, to try with him thestrength of my youth.CELIAYoung gentleman, your spirits are too bold for youryears. You have seen cruel proof of this man'sstrength: if you saw yourself with your eyes orknew yourself with your judgment, the fear of youradventure would counsel you to a more equalenterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, toembrace your own safety and give over this attempt.ROSALINDDo, young sir; your reputation shall not thereforebe misprised: we will make it our suit to the dukethat the wrestling might not go forward.ORLANDOI beseech you, punish me not with your hardthoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to denyso fair and excellent ladies any thing. But letyour fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to mytrial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but oneshamed that was never gracious; if killed, but onedead that was willing to be so: I shall do myfriends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, theworld no injury, for in it I have nothing; only inthe world I fill up a place, which may be bettersupplied when I have made it empty.ROSALINDThe little strength that I have, I would it were with you.CELIAAnd mine, to eke out hers.ROSALINDFare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!CELIAYour heart's desires be with you!CHARLESCome, where is this young gallant that is sodesirous to lie with his mother earth?ORLANDOReady, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.DUKE FREDERICKYou shall try but one fall.CHARLESNo, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat himto a second, that have so mightily persuaded himfrom a first.ORLANDOAn you mean to mock me after, you should not havemocked me before: but come your ways.ROSALINDNow Hercules be thy speed, young man!CELIAI would I were invisible, to catch the strongfellow by the leg.They wrestleROSALINDO excellent young man!CELIAIf I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell whoshould down.Shout. CHARLES is thrownDUKE FREDERICKNo more, no more.ORLANDOYes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.DUKE FREDERICKHow dost thou, Charles?LE BEAUHe cannot speak, my lord.DUKE FREDERICKBear him away. What is thy name, young man?ORLANDOOrlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.DUKE FREDERICKI would thou hadst been son to some man else:The world esteem'd thy father honourable,But I did find him still mine enemy:Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,Hadst thou descended from another house.But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:I would thou hadst told me of another father.Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAUCELIAWere I my father, coz, would I do this?ORLANDOI am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,His youngest son; and would not change that calling,To be adopted heir to Frederick.ROSALINDMy father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,And all the world was of my father's mind:Had I before known this young man his son,I should have given him tears unto entreaties,Ere he should thus have ventured.CELIAGentle cousin,Let us go thank him and encourage him:My father's rough and envious dispositionSticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:If you do keep your promises in loveBut justly, as you have exceeded all promise,Your mistress shall be happy.ROSALINDGentleman,Giving him a chain from her neckWear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.Shall we go, coz?CELIAAy. Fare you well, fair gentleman.ORLANDOCan I not say, I thank you? My better partsAre all thrown down, and that which here stands upIs but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.ROSALINDHe calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrownMore than your enemies.CELIAWill you go, coz?ROSALINDHave with you. Fare you well.Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIAORLANDOWhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.Re-enter LE BEAULE BEAUGood sir, I do in friendship counsel youTo leave this place. Albeit you have deservedHigh commendation, true applause and love,Yet such is now the duke's conditionThat he misconstrues all that you have done.The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.ORLANDOI thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:Which of the two was daughter of the dukeThat here was at the wrestling?LE BEAUNeither his daughter, if we judge by manners;But yet indeed the lesser is his daughterThe other is daughter to the banish'd duke,And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,To keep his daughter company; whose lovesAre dearer than the natural bond of sisters.But I can tell you that of late this dukeHath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,Grounded upon no other argumentBut that the people praise her for her virtuesAnd pity her for her good father's sake;And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the ladyWill suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:Hereafter, in a better world than this,I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.ORLANDOI rest much bounden to you: fare you well.Exit LE BEAUThus must I from the smoke into the smother;From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:But heavenly Rosalind!ExitSCENE III. A room in the palace.Enter CELIA and ROSALINDCELIAWhy, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?ROSALINDNot one to throw at a dog.CELIANo, thy words are too precious to be cast away uponcurs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.ROSALINDThen there were two cousins laid up; when the oneshould be lamed with reasons and the other madwithout any.CELIABut is all this for your father?ROSALINDNo, some of it is for my child's father. O, howfull of briers is this working-day world!CELIAThey are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee inholiday foolery: if we walk not in the troddenpaths our very petticoats will catch them.ROSALINDI could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.CELIAHem them away.ROSALINDI would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.CELIACome, come, wrestle with thy affections.ROSALINDO, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!CELIAO, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, indespite of a fall. But, turning these jests out ofservice, let us talk in good earnest: is itpossible, on such a sudden, you should fall into sostrong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?ROSALINDThe duke my father loved his father dearly.CELIADoth it therefore ensue that you should love his sondearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hatenot Orlando.ROSALINDNo, faith, hate him not, for my sake.CELIAWhy should I not? doth he not deserve well?ROSALINDLet me love him for that, and do you love himbecause I do. Look, here comes the duke.CELIAWith his eyes full of anger.Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LordsDUKE FREDERICKMistress, dispatch you with your safest hasteAnd get you from our court.ROSALINDMe, uncle?DUKE FREDERICKYou, cousinWithin these ten days if that thou be'st foundSo near our public court as twenty miles,Thou diest for it.ROSALINDI do beseech your grace,Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:If with myself I hold intelligenceOr have acquaintance with mine own desires,If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,Never so much as in a thought unbornDid I offend your highness.DUKE FREDERICKThus do all traitors:If their purgation did consist in words,They are as innocent as grace itself:Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.ROSALINDYet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.DUKE FREDERICKThou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.ROSALINDSo was I when your highness took his dukedom;So was I when your highness banish'd him:Treason is not inherited, my lord;Or, if we did derive it from our friends,What's that to me? my father was no traitor:Then, good my liege, mistake me not so muchTo think my poverty is treacherous.CELIADear sovereign, hear me speak.DUKE FREDERICKAy, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,Else had she with her father ranged along.CELIAI did not then entreat to have her stay;It was your pleasure and your own remorse:I was too young that time to value her;But now I know her: if she be a traitor,Why so am I; we still have slept together,Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,Still we went coupled and inseparable.DUKE FREDERICKShe is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,Her very silence and her patienceSpeak to the people, and they pity her.Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuousWhen she is gone. Then open not thy lips:Firm and irrevocable is my doomWhich I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.CELIAPronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:I cannot live out of her company.DUKE FREDERICKYou are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,And in the greatness of my word, you die.Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and LordsCELIAO my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.ROSALINDI have more cause.CELIAThou hast not, cousin;Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the dukeHath banish'd me, his daughter?ROSALINDThat he hath not.CELIANo, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the loveWhich teacheth thee that thou and I am one:Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?No: let my father seek another heir.Therefore devise with me how we may fly,Whither to go and what to bear with us;And do not seek to take your change upon you,To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.ROSALINDWhy, whither shall we go?CELIATo seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.ROSALINDAlas, what danger will it be to us,Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.CELIAI'll put myself in poor and mean attireAnd with a kind of umber smirch my face;The like do you: so shall we pass alongAnd never stir assailants.ROSALINDWere it not better,Because that I am more than common tall,That I did suit me all points like a man?A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heartLie there what hidden woman's fear there will--We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,As many other mannish cowards haveThat do outface it with their semblances.CELIAWhat shall I call thee when thou art a man?ROSALINDI'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;And therefore look you call me Ganymede.But what will you be call'd?CELIASomething that hath a reference to my stateNo longer Celia, but Aliena.ROSALINDBut, cousin, what if we assay'd to stealThe clownish fool out of your father's court?Would he not be a comfort to our travel?CELIAHe'll go along o'er the wide world with me;Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,And get our jewels and our wealth together,Devise the fittest time and safest wayTo hide us from pursuit that will be madeAfter my flight. Now go we in contentTo liberty and not to banishment.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. The Forest of Arden.Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like forestersDUKE SENIORNow, my co-mates and brothers in exile,Hath not old custom made this life more sweetThan that of painted pomp? Are not these woodsMore free from peril than the envious court?Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,The seasons' difference, as the icy fangAnd churlish chiding of the winter's wind,Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say'This is no flattery: these are counsellorsThat feelingly persuade me what I am.'Sweet are the uses of adversity,Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;And this our life exempt from public hauntFinds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,Sermons in stones and good in every thing.I would not change it.AMIENSHappy is your grace,That can translate the stubbornness of fortuneInto so quiet and so sweet a style.DUKE SENIORCome, shall we go and kill us venison?And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,Being native burghers of this desert city,Should in their own confines with forked headsHave their round haunches gored.First LordIndeed, my lord,The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,And, in that kind, swears you do more usurpThan doth your brother that hath banish'd you.To-day my Lord of Amiens and myselfDid steal behind him as he lay alongUnder an oak whose antique root peeps outUpon the brook that brawls along this wood:To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,The wretched animal heaved forth such groansThat their discharge did stretch his leathern coatAlmost to bursting, and the big round tearsCoursed one another down his innocent noseIn piteous chase; and thus the hairy foolMuch marked of the melancholy Jaques,Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,Augmenting it with tears.DUKE SENIORBut what said Jaques?Did he not moralize this spectacle?First LordO, yes, into a thousand similes.First, for his weeping into the needless stream;'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testamentAs worldlings do, giving thy sum of moreTo that which had too much:' then, being there alone,Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth partThe flux of company:' anon a careless herd,Full of the pasture, jumps along by himAnd never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you lookUpon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'Thus most invectively he pierceth throughThe body of the country, city, court,Yea, and of this our life, swearing that weAre mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,To fright the animals and to kill them upIn their assign'd and native dwelling-place.DUKE SENIORAnd did you leave him in this contemplation?Second LordWe did, my lord, weeping and commentingUpon the sobbing deer.DUKE SENIORShow me the place:I love to cope him in these sullen fits,For then he's full of matter.First LordI'll bring you to him straight.ExeuntSCENE II. A room in the palace.Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LordsDUKE FREDERICKCan it be possible that no man saw them?It cannot be: some villains of my courtAre of consent and sufferance in this.First LordI cannot hear of any that did see her.The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,Saw her abed, and in the morning earlyThey found the bed untreasured of their mistress.Second LordMy lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oftYour grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,Confesses that she secretly o'erheardYour daughter and her cousin much commendThe parts and graces of the wrestlerThat did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;And she believes, wherever they are gone,That youth is surely in their company.DUKE FREDERICKSend to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;If he be absent, bring his brother to me;I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,And let not search and inquisition quailTo bring again these foolish runaways.ExeuntSCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meetingORLANDOWho's there?ADAMWhat, my young master? O, my gentle master!O my sweet master! O you memoryOf old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?Why would you be so fond to overcomeThe bonny priser of the humorous duke?Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.Know you not, master, to some kind of menTheir graces serve them but as enemies?No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.O, what a world is this, when what is comelyEnvenoms him that bears it!ORLANDOWhy, what's the matter?ADAMO unhappy youth!Come not within these doors; within this roofThe enemy of all your graces lives:Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--Yet not the son, I will not call him sonOf him I was about to call his father--Hath heard your praises, and this night he meansTo burn the lodging where you use to lieAnd you within it: if he fail of that,He will have other means to cut you off.I overheard him and his practises.This is no place; this house is but a butchery:Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.ORLANDOWhy, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?ADAMNo matter whither, so you come not here.ORLANDOWhat, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?Or with a base and boisterous sword enforceA thievish living on the common road?This I must do, or know not what to do:Yet this I will not do, do how I can;I rather will subject me to the maliceOf a diverted blood and bloody brother.ADAMBut do not so. I have five hundred crowns,The thrifty hire I saved under your father,Which I did store to be my foster-nurseWhen service should in my old limbs lie lameAnd unregarded age in corners thrown:Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;For in my youth I never did applyHot and rebellious liquors in my blood,Nor did not with unbashful forehead wooThe means of weakness and debility;Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;I'll do the service of a younger manIn all your business and necessities.ORLANDOO good old man, how well in thee appearsThe constant service of the antique world,When service sweat for duty, not for meed!Thou art not for the fashion of these times,Where none will sweat but for promotion,And having that, do choke their service upEven with the having: it is not so with thee.But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,That cannot so much as a blossom yieldIn lieu of all thy pains and husbandryBut come thy ways; well go along together,And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,We'll light upon some settled low content.ADAMMaster, go on, and I will follow thee,To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.From seventeen years till now almost fourscoreHere lived I, but now live here no more.At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;But at fourscore it is too late a week:Yet fortune cannot recompense me betterThan to die well and not my master's debtor.ExeuntSCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONEROSALINDO Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!TOUCHSTONEI care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.ROSALINDI could find in my heart to disgrace my man'sapparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfortthe weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to showitself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,good Aliena!CELIAI pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.TOUCHSTONEFor my part, I had rather bear with you than bearyou; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,for I think you have no money in your purse.ROSALINDWell, this is the forest of Arden.TOUCHSTONEAy, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I wasat home, I was in a better place: but travellersmust be content.ROSALINDAy, be so, good Touchstone.Enter CORIN and SILVIUSLook you, who comes here; a young man and an old insolemn talk.CORINThat is the way to make her scorn you still.SILVIUSO Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!CORINI partly guess; for I have loved ere now.SILVIUSNo, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,Though in thy youth thou wast as true a loverAs ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:But if thy love were ever like to mine--As sure I think did never man love so--How many actions most ridiculousHast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?CORINInto a thousand that I have forgotten.SILVIUSO, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!If thou remember'st not the slightest follyThat ever love did make thee run into,Thou hast not loved:Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,Thou hast not loved:Or if thou hast not broke from companyAbruptly, as my passion now makes me,Thou hast not loved.O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!ExitROSALINDAlas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,I have by hard adventure found mine own.TOUCHSTONEAnd I mine. I remember, when I was in love I brokemy sword upon a stone and bid him take that forcoming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember thekissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that herpretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember thewooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I tooktwo cods and, giving her them again, said withweeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that aretrue lovers run into strange capers; but as all ismortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.ROSALINDThou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.TOUCHSTONENay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till Ibreak my shins against it.ROSALINDJove, Jove! this shepherd's passionIs much upon my fashion.TOUCHSTONEAnd mine; but it grows something stale with me.CELIAI pray you, one of you question yond manIf he for gold will give us any food:I faint almost to death.TOUCHSTONEHolla, you clown!ROSALINDPeace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.CORINWho calls?TOUCHSTONEYour betters, sir.CORINElse are they very wretched.ROSALINDPeace, I say. Good even to you, friend.CORINAnd to you, gentle sir, and to you all.ROSALINDI prithee, shepherd, if that love or goldCan in this desert place buy entertainment,Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'dAnd faints for succor.CORINFair sir, I pity herAnd wish, for her sake more than for mine own,My fortunes were more able to relieve her;But I am shepherd to another manAnd do not shear the fleeces that I graze:My master is of churlish dispositionAnd little recks to find the way to heavenBy doing deeds of hospitality:Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feedAre now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,By reason of his absence, there is nothingThat you will feed on; but what is, come see.And in my voice most welcome shall you be.ROSALINDWhat is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?CORINThat young swain that you saw here but erewhile,That little cares for buying any thing.ROSALINDI pray thee, if it stand with honesty,Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.CELIAAnd we will mend thy wages. I like this place.And willingly could waste my time in it.CORINAssuredly the thing is to be sold:Go with me: if you like upon reportThe soil, the profit and this kind of life,I will your very faithful feeder beAnd buy it with your gold right suddenly.ExeuntSCENE V. The Forest.Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and othersSONG.AMIENSUnder the greenwood treeWho loves to lie with me,And turn his merry noteUnto the sweet bird's throat,Come hither, come hither, come hither:Here shall he see No enemyBut winter and rough weather.JAQUESMore, more, I prithee, more.AMIENSIt will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.JAQUESI thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suckmelancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.More, I prithee, more.AMIENSMy voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.JAQUESI do not desire you to please me; I do desire you tosing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?AMIENSWhat you will, Monsieur Jaques.JAQUESNay, I care not for their names; they owe menothing. Will you sing?AMIENSMore at your request than to please myself.JAQUESWell then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;but that they call compliment is like the encounterof two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,methinks I have given him a penny and he renders methe beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that willnot, hold your tongues.AMIENSWell, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; theduke will drink under this tree. He hath been allthis day to look you.JAQUESAnd I have been all this day to avoid him. He istoo disputable for my company: I think of as manymatters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make noboast of them. Come, warble, come.SONG.Who doth ambition shunAll together hereAnd loves to live i' the sun,Seeking the food he eatsAnd pleased with what he gets,Come hither, come hither, come hither:Here shall he see No enemyBut winter and rough weather.JAQUESI'll give you a verse to this note that I madeyesterday in despite of my invention.AMIENSAnd I'll sing it.JAQUESThus it goes:--If it do come to passThat any man turn ass,Leaving his wealth and ease,A stubborn will to please,Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:Here shall he seeGross fools as he,An if he will come to me.AMIENSWhat's that 'ducdame'?JAQUES'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into acircle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'llrail against all the first-born of Egypt.AMIENSAnd I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.Exeunt severallySCENE VI. The forest.Enter ORLANDO and ADAMADAMDear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,kind master.ORLANDOWhy, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Livea little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, Iwill either be food for it or bring it for food tothee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile atthe arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;and if I bring thee not something to eat, I willgive thee leave to die: but if thou diest before Icome, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bearthee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die forlack of a dinner, if there live any thing in thisdesert. Cheerly, good Adam!ExeuntSCENE VII. The forest.A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlawsDUKE SENIORI think he be transform'd into a beast;For I can no where find him like a man.First LordMy lord, he is but even now gone hence:Here was he merry, hearing of a song.DUKE SENIORIf he, compact of jars, grow musical,We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.Enter JAQUESFirst LordHe saves my labour by his own approach.DUKE SENIORWhy, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,That your poor friends must woo your company?What, you look merrily!JAQUESA fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,A motley fool; a miserable world!As I do live by food, I met a foolWho laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,In good set terms and yet a motley fool.'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'And then he drew a dial from his poke,And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hearThe motley fool thus moral on the time,My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,That fools should be so deep-contemplative,And I did laugh sans intermissionAn hour by his dial. O noble fool!A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.DUKE SENIORWhat fool is this?JAQUESO worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,And says, if ladies be but young and fair,They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,Which is as dry as the remainder biscuitAfter a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'dWith observation, the which he ventsIn mangled forms. O that I were a fool!I am ambitious for a motley coat.DUKE SENIORThou shalt have one.JAQUESIt is my only suit;Provided that you weed your better judgmentsOf all opinion that grows rank in themThat I am wise. I must have libertyWithal, as large a charter as the wind,To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;And they that are most galled with my folly,They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:He that a fool doth very wisely hitDoth very foolishly, although he smart,Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,The wise man's folly is anatomizedEven by the squandering glances of the fool.Invest me in my motley; give me leaveTo speak my mind, and I will through and throughCleanse the foul body of the infected world,If they will patiently receive my medicine.DUKE SENIORFie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.JAQUESWhat, for a counter, would I do but good?DUKE SENIORMost mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:For thou thyself hast been a libertine,As sensual as the brutish sting itself;And all the embossed sores and headed evils,That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.JAQUESWhy, who cries out on pride,That can therein tax any private party?Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,Till that the weary very means do ebb?What woman in the city do I name,When that I say the city-woman bearsThe cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?Who can come in and say that I mean her,When such a one as she such is her neighbour?Or what is he of basest functionThat says his bravery is not of my cost,Thinking that I mean him, but therein suitsHis folly to the mettle of my speech?There then; how then? what then? Let me see whereinMy tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawnORLANDOForbear, and eat no more.JAQUESWhy, I have eat none yet.ORLANDONor shalt not, till necessity be served.JAQUESOf what kind should this cock come of?DUKE SENIORArt thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,Or else a rude despiser of good manners,That in civility thou seem'st so empty?ORLANDOYou touch'd my vein at first: the thorny pointOf bare distress hath ta'en from me the showOf smooth civility: yet am I inland bredAnd know some nurture. But forbear, I say:He dies that touches any of this fruitTill I and my affairs are answered.JAQUESAn you will not be answered with reason, I must die.DUKE SENIORWhat would you have? Your gentleness shall forceMore than your force move us to gentleness.ORLANDOI almost die for food; and let me have it.DUKE SENIORSit down and feed, and welcome to our table.ORLANDOSpeak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:I thought that all things had been savage here;And therefore put I on the countenanceOf stern commandment. But whate'er you areThat in this desert inaccessible,Under the shade of melancholy boughs,Lose and neglect the creeping hours of timeIf ever you have look'd on better days,If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,If ever sat at any good man's feast,If ever from your eyelids wiped a tearAnd know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.DUKE SENIORTrue is it that we have seen better days,And have with holy bell been knoll'd to churchAnd sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyesOf drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:And therefore sit you down in gentlenessAnd take upon command what help we haveThat to your wanting may be minister'd.ORLANDOThen but forbear your food a little while,Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawnAnd give it food. There is an old poor man,Who after me hath many a weary stepLimp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,I will not touch a bit.DUKE SENIORGo find him out,And we will nothing waste till you return.ORLANDOI thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!ExitDUKE SENIORThou seest we are not all alone unhappy:This wide and universal theatrePresents more woeful pageants than the sceneWherein we play in.JAQUESAll the world's a stage,And all the men and women merely players:They have their exits and their entrances;And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.And then the whining school-boy, with his satchelAnd shining morning face, creeping like snailUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,Sighing like furnace, with a woeful balladMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,Seeking the bubble reputationEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,In fair round belly with good capon lined,With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,Full of wise saws and modern instances;And so he plays his part. The sixth age shiftsInto the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wideFor his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,Turning again toward childish treble, pipesAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,That ends this strange eventful history,Is second childishness and mere oblivion,Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAMDUKE SENIORWelcome. Set down your venerable burthen,And let him feed.ORLANDOI thank you most for him.ADAMSo had you need:I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.DUKE SENIORWelcome; fall to: I will not trouble youAs yet, to question you about your fortunes.Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.SONG.AMIENSBlow, blow, thou winter wind.Thou art not so unkindAs man's ingratitude;Thy tooth is not so keen,Because thou art not seen,Although thy breath be rude.Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:Then, heigh-ho, the holly!This life is most jolly.Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,That dost not bite so nighAs benefits forgot:Though thou the waters warp,Thy sting is not so sharpAs friend remember'd not.Heigh-ho! sing,  & c.DUKE SENIORIf that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,And as mine eye doth his effigies witnessMost truly limn'd and living in your face,Be truly welcome hither: I am the dukeThat loved your father: the residue of your fortune,Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,Thou art right welcome as thy master is.Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,And let me all your fortunes understand.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. A room in the palace.Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVERDUKE FREDERICKNot see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:But were I not the better part made mercy,I should not seek an absent argumentOf my revenge, thou present. But look to it:Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;Seek him with candle; bring him dead or livingWithin this twelvemonth, or turn thou no moreTo seek a living in our territory.Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thineWorth seizure do we seize into our hands,Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouthOf what we think against thee.OLIVERO that your highness knew my heart in this!I never loved my brother in my life.DUKE FREDERICKMore villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;And let my officers of such a natureMake an extent upon his house and lands:Do this expediently and turn him going.ExeuntSCENE II. The forest.Enter ORLANDO, with a paperORLANDOHang there, my verse, in witness of my love:And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, surveyWith thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.O Rosalind! these trees shall be my booksAnd in their barks my thoughts I'll character;That every eye which in this forest looksShall see thy virtue witness'd every where.Run, run, Orlando; carve on every treeThe fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.ExitEnter CORIN and TOUCHSTONECORINAnd how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?TOUCHSTONETruly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a goodlife, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, Ilike it very well; but in respect that it isprivate, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect itis in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but inrespect it is not in the court, it is tedious. Asis it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes muchagainst my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?CORINNo more but that I know the more one sickens theworse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,means and content is without three good friends;that the property of rain is to wet and fire toburn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that agreat cause of the night is lack of the sun; thathe that hath learned no wit by nature nor art maycomplain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.TOUCHSTONESuch a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever incourt, shepherd?CORINNo, truly.TOUCHSTONEThen thou art damned.CORINNay, I hope.TOUCHSTONETruly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, allon one side.CORINFor not being at court? Your reason.TOUCHSTONEWhy, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawestgood manners; if thou never sawest good manners,then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness issin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlousstate, shepherd.CORINNot a whit, Touchstone: those that are good mannersat the court are as ridiculous in the country as thebehavior of the country is most mockable at thecourt. You told me you salute not at the court, butyou kiss your hands: that courtesy would beuncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.TOUCHSTONEInstance, briefly; come, instance.CORINWhy, we are still handling our ewes, and theirfells, you know, are greasy.TOUCHSTONEWhy, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is notthe grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat ofa man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.CORINBesides, our hands are hard.TOUCHSTONEYour lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.A more sounder instance, come.CORINAnd they are often tarred over with the surgery ofour sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? Thecourtier's hands are perfumed with civet.TOUCHSTONEMost shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of agood piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, andperpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, thevery uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.CORINYou have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.TOUCHSTONEWilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!God make incision in thee! thou art raw.CORINSir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, getthat I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man'shappiness, glad of other men's good, content with myharm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewesgraze and my lambs suck.TOUCHSTONEThat is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewesand the rams together and to offer to get yourliving by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to abell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of atwelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,out of all reasonable match. If thou beest notdamned for this, the devil himself will have noshepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst'scape.CORINHere comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, readingROSALINDFrom the east to western Ind,No jewel is like Rosalind.Her worth, being mounted on the wind,Through all the world bears Rosalind.All the pictures fairest linedAre but black to Rosalind.Let no fair be kept in mindBut the fair of Rosalind.TOUCHSTONEI'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners andsuppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is theright butter-women's rank to market.ROSALINDOut, fool!TOUCHSTONEFor a taste:If a hart do lack a hind,Let him seek out Rosalind.If the cat will after kind,So be sure will Rosalind.Winter garments must be lined,So must slender Rosalind.They that reap must sheaf and bind;Then to cart with Rosalind.Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,Such a nut is Rosalind.He that sweetest rose will findMust find love's prick and Rosalind.This is the very false gallop of verses: why do youinfect yourself with them?ROSALINDPeace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.TOUCHSTONETruly, the tree yields bad fruit.ROSALINDI'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff itwith a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruiti' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be halfripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.TOUCHSTONEYou have said; but whether wisely or no, let theforest judge.Enter CELIA, with a writingROSALINDPeace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.CELIA[Reads]Why should this a desert be?For it is unpeopled? No:Tongues I'll hang on every tree,That shall civil sayings show:Some, how brief the life of manRuns his erring pilgrimage,That the stretching of a spanBuckles in his sum of age;Some, of violated vows'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:But upon the fairest boughs,Or at every sentence end,Will I Rosalinda write,Teaching all that read to knowThe quintessence of every spriteHeaven would in little show.Therefore Heaven Nature chargedThat one body should be fill'dWith all graces wide-enlarged:Nature presently distill'dHelen's cheek, but not her heart,Cleopatra's majesty,Atalanta's better part,Sad Lucretia's modesty.Thus Rosalind of many partsBy heavenly synod was devised,Of many faces, eyes and hearts,To have the touches dearest prized.Heaven would that she these gifts should have,And I to live and die her slave.ROSALINDO most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of lovehave you wearied your parishioners withal, and nevercried 'Have patience, good people!'CELIAHow now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.Go with him, sirrah.TOUCHSTONECome, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONECELIADidst thou hear these verses?ROSALINDO, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some ofthem had in them more feet than the verses would bear.CELIAThat's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.ROSALINDAy, but the feet were lame and could not bearthemselves without the verse and therefore stoodlamely in the verse.CELIABut didst thou hear without wondering how thy nameshould be hanged and carved upon these trees?ROSALINDI was seven of the nine days out of the wonderbefore you came; for look here what I found on apalm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed sincePythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which Ican hardly remember.CELIATrow you who hath done this?ROSALINDIs it a man?CELIAAnd a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.Change you colour?ROSALINDI prithee, who?CELIAO Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends tomeet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakesand so encounter.ROSALINDNay, but who is it?CELIAIs it possible?ROSALINDNay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,tell me who it is.CELIAO wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderfulwonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,out of all hooping!ROSALINDGood my complexion! dost thou think, though I amcaparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose inmy disposition? One inch of delay more is aSouth-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is itquickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldststammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed manout of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none atall. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth thatmay drink thy tidings.CELIASo you may put a man in your belly.ROSALINDIs he of God's making? What manner of man? Is hishead worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?CELIANay, he hath but a little beard.ROSALINDWhy, God will send more, if the man will bethankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, ifthou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.CELIAIt is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler'sheels and your heart both in an instant.ROSALINDNay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow andtrue maid.CELIAI' faith, coz, 'tis he.ROSALINDOrlando?CELIAOrlando.ROSALINDAlas the day! what shall I do with my doublet andhose? What did he when thou sawest him? What saidhe? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makeshim here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou seehim again? Answer me in one word.CELIAYou must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis aword too great for any mouth of this age's size. Tosay ay and no to these particulars is more than toanswer in a catechism.ROSALINDBut doth he know that I am in this forest and inman's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did theday he wrestled?CELIAIt is as easy to count atomies as to resolve thepropositions of a lover; but take a taste of myfinding him, and relish it with good observance.I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.ROSALINDIt may well be called Jove's tree, when it dropsforth such fruit.CELIAGive me audience, good madam.ROSALINDProceed.CELIAThere lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.ROSALINDThough it be pity to see such a sight, it wellbecomes the ground.CELIACry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvetsunseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.ROSALINDO, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.CELIAI would sing my song without a burden: thou bringestme out of tune.ROSALINDDo you not know I am a woman? when I think, I mustspeak. Sweet, say on.CELIAYou bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?Enter ORLANDO and JAQUESROSALIND'Tis he: slink by, and note him.JAQUESI thank you for your company; but, good faith, I hadas lief have been myself alone.ORLANDOAnd so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank youtoo for your society.JAQUESGod be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.ORLANDOI do desire we may be better strangers.JAQUESI pray you, mar no more trees with writinglove-songs in their barks.ORLANDOI pray you, mar no more of my verses with readingthem ill-favouredly.JAQUESRosalind is your love's name?ORLANDOYes, just.JAQUESI do not like her name.ORLANDOThere was no thought of pleasing you when she waschristened.JAQUESWhat stature is she of?ORLANDOJust as high as my heart.JAQUESYou are full of pretty answers. Have you not beenacquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned themout of rings?ORLANDONot so; but I answer you right painted cloth, fromwhence you have studied your questions.JAQUESYou have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made ofAtalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? andwe two will rail against our mistress the world andall our misery.ORLANDOI will chide no breather in the world but myself,against whom I know most faults.JAQUESThe worst fault you have is to be in love.ORLANDO'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.I am weary of you.JAQUESBy my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I foundyou.ORLANDOHe is drowned in the brook: look but in, and youshall see him.JAQUESThere I shall see mine own figure.ORLANDOWhich I take to be either a fool or a cipher.JAQUESI'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, goodSignior Love.ORLANDOI am glad of your departure: adieu, good MonsieurMelancholy.Exit JAQUESROSALIND[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucylackey and under that habit play the knave with him.Do you hear, forester?ORLANDOVery well: what would you?ROSALINDI pray you, what is't o'clock?ORLANDOYou should ask me what time o' day: there's no clockin the forest.ROSALINDThen there is no true lover in the forest; elsesighing every minute and groaning every hour woulddetect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.ORLANDOAnd why not the swift foot of Time? had not thatbeen as proper?ROSALINDBy no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces withdivers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambleswithal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallopswithal and who he stands still withal.ORLANDOI prithee, who doth he trot withal?ROSALINDMarry, he trots hard with a young maid between thecontract of her marriage and the day it issolemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length ofseven year.ORLANDOWho ambles Time withal?ROSALINDWith a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man thathath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily becausehe cannot study, and the other lives merrily becausehe feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of leanand wasteful learning, the other knowing no burdenof heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.ORLANDOWho doth he gallop withal?ROSALINDWith a thief to the gallows, for though he go assoftly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.ORLANDOWho stays it still withal?ROSALINDWith lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep betweenterm and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.ORLANDOWhere dwell you, pretty youth?ROSALINDWith this shepherdess, my sister; here in theskirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.ORLANDOAre you native of this place?ROSALINDAs the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.ORLANDOYour accent is something finer than you couldpurchase in so removed a dwelling.ROSALINDI have been told so of many: but indeed an oldreligious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who wasin his youth an inland man; one that knew courtshiptoo well, for there he fell in love. I have heardhim read many lectures against it, and I thank GodI am not a woman, to be touched with so manygiddy offences as he hath generally taxed theirwhole sex withal.ORLANDOCan you remember any of the principal evils that helaid to the charge of women?ROSALINDThere were none principal; they were all like oneanother as half-pence are, every one fault seemingmonstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.ORLANDOI prithee, recount some of them.ROSALINDNo, I will not cast away my physic but on those thatare sick. There is a man haunts the forest, thatabuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' ontheir barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegieson brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name ofRosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I wouldgive him some good counsel, for he seems to have thequotidian of love upon him.ORLANDOI am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell meyour remedy.ROSALINDThere is none of my uncle's marks upon you: hetaught me how to know a man in love; in which cageof rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.ORLANDOWhat were his marks?ROSALINDA lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye andsunken, which you have not, an unquestionablespirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,which you have not; but I pardon you for that, forsimply your having in beard is a younger brother'srevenue: then your hose should be ungartered, yourbonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoeuntied and every thing about you demonstrating acareless desolation; but you are no such man; youare rather point-device in your accoutrements asloving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.ORLANDOFair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.ROSALINDMe believe it! you may as soon make her that youlove believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter todo than to confess she does: that is one of thepoints in the which women still give the lie totheir consciences. But, in good sooth, are you hethat hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalindis so admired?ORLANDOI swear to thee, youth, by the white hand ofRosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.ROSALINDBut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?ORLANDONeither rhyme nor reason can express how much.ROSALINDLove is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deservesas well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: andthe reason why they are not so punished and curedis, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippersare in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.ORLANDODid you ever cure any so?ROSALINDYes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine mehis love, his mistress; and I set him every day towoo me: at which time would I, being but a moonishyouth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longingand liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for everypassion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and women are for the most partcattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathehim; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weepfor him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitorfrom his mad humour of love to a living humour ofmadness; which was, to forswear the full stream ofthe world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.And thus I cured him; and this way will I take uponme to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep'sheart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.ORLANDOI would not be cured, youth.ROSALINDI would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalindand come every day to my cote and woo me.ORLANDONow, by the faith of my love, I will: tell mewhere it is.ROSALINDGo with me to it and I'll show it you and by the wayyou shall tell me where in the forest you live.Will you go?ORLANDOWith all my heart, good youth.ROSALINDNay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?ExeuntSCENE III. The forest.Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behindTOUCHSTONECome apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up yourgoats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?doth my simple feature content you?AUDREYYour features! Lord warrant us! what features!TOUCHSTONEI am here with thee and thy goats, as the mostcapricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.JAQUES[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jovein a thatched house!TOUCHSTONEWhen a man's verses cannot be understood, nor aman's good wit seconded with the forward childUnderstanding, it strikes a man more dead than agreat reckoning in a little room. Truly, I wouldthe gods had made thee poetical.AUDREYI do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest indeed and word? is it a true thing?TOUCHSTONENo, truly; for the truest poetry is the mostfeigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and whatthey swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.AUDREYDo you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?TOUCHSTONEI do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou arthonest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have somehope thou didst feign.AUDREYWould you not have me honest?TOUCHSTONENo, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; forhonesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.JAQUES[Aside]  A material fool!AUDREYWell, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the godsmake me honest.TOUCHSTONETruly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slutwere to put good meat into an unclean dish.AUDREYI am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.TOUCHSTONEWell, praised be the gods for thy foulness!sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it maybe, I will marry thee, and to that end I have beenwith Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the nextvillage, who hath promised to meet me in this placeof the forest and to couple us.JAQUES[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.AUDREYWell, the gods give us joy!TOUCHSTONEAmen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,stagger in this attempt; for here we have no templebut the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But whatthough? C ourage! As horns are odious, they arenecessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end ofhis goods:' right; many a man has good horns, andknows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry ofhis wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deerhath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single mantherefore blessed? No: as a walled town is moreworthier than a village, so is the forehead of amarried man more honourable than the bare brow of abachelor; and by how much defence is better than noskill, by so much is a horn more precious than towant. Here comes Sir Oliver.Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXTSir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will youdispatch us here under this tree, or shall we gowith you to your chapel?SIR OLIVER MARTEXTIs there none here to give the woman?TOUCHSTONEI will not take her on gift of any man.SIR OLIVER MARTEXTTruly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.JAQUES[Advancing]Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.TOUCHSTONEGood even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for yourlast company: I am very glad to see you: even atoy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.JAQUESWill you be married, motley?TOUCHSTONEAs the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb andthe falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; andas pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.JAQUESAnd will you, being a man of your breeding, bemarried under a bush like a beggar? Get you tochurch, and have a good priest that can tell youwhat marriage is: this fellow will but join youtogether as they join wainscot; then one of you willprove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.TOUCHSTONE[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to bemarried of him than of another: for he is not liketo marry me well; and not being well married, itwill be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.JAQUESGo thou with me, and let me counsel thee.TOUCHSTONE'Come, sweet Audrey:We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--O sweet Oliver,O brave Oliver,Leave me not behind thee: but,--Wind away,Begone, I say,I will not to wedding with thee.Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREYSIR OLIVER MARTEXT'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of themall shall flout me out of my calling.ExitSCENE IV. The forest.Enter ROSALIND and CELIAROSALINDNever talk to me; I will weep.CELIADo, I prithee; but yet have the grace to considerthat tears do not become a man.ROSALINDBut have I not cause to weep?CELIAAs good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.ROSALINDHis very hair is of the dissembling colour.CELIASomething browner than Judas's marry, his kisses areJudas's own children.ROSALINDI' faith, his hair is of a good colour.CELIAAn excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.ROSALINDAnd his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touchof holy bread.CELIAHe hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nunof winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;the very ice of chastity is in them.ROSALINDBut why did he swear he would come this morning, andcomes not?CELIANay, certainly, there is no truth in him.ROSALINDDo you think so?CELIAYes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor ahorse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I dothink him as concave as a covered goblet or aworm-eaten nut.ROSALINDNot true in love?CELIAYes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.ROSALINDYou have heard him swear downright he was.CELIA'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover isno stronger than the word of a tapster; they areboth the confirmer of false reckonings. He attendshere in the forest on the duke your father.ROSALINDI met the duke yesterday and had much question withhim: he asked me of what parentage I was; I toldhim, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.But what talk we of fathers, when there is such aman as Orlando?CELIAO, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaksthem bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart ofhis lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horsebut on one side, breaks his staff like a noblegoose: but all's brave that youth mounts and follyguides. Who comes here?Enter CORINCORINMistress and master, you have oft inquiredAfter the shepherd that complain'd of love,Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,Praising the proud disdainful shepherdessThat was his mistress.CELIAWell, and what of him?CORINIf you will see a pageant truly play'd,Between the pale complexion of true loveAnd the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,If you will mark it.ROSALINDO, come, let us remove:The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.Bring us to this sight, and you shall sayI'll prove a busy actor in their play.ExeuntSCENE V. Another part of the forest.Enter SILVIUS and PHEBESILVIUSSweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;Say that you love me not, but say not soIn bitterness. The common executioner,Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,Falls not the axe upon the humbled neckBut first begs pardon: will you sterner beThan he that dies and lives by bloody drops?Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behindPHEBEI would not be thy executioner:I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,Who shut their coward gates on atomies,Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remainsSome scar of it; lean but upon a rush,The cicatrice and capable impressureThy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyesThat can do hurt.SILVIUSO dear Phebe,If ever,--as that ever may be near,--You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,Then shall you know the wounds invisibleThat love's keen arrows make.PHEBEBut till that timeCome not thou near me: and when that time comes,Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;As till that time I shall not pity thee.ROSALINDAnd why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,That you insult, exult, and all at once,Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--As, by my faith, I see no more in youThan without candle may go dark to bed--Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?I see no more in you than in the ordinaryOf nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,I think she means to tangle my eyes too!No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,That can entame my spirits to your worship.You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?You are a thousand times a properer manThan she a woman: 'tis such fools as youThat makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;And out of you she sees herself more properThan any of her lineaments can show her.But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:For I must tell you friendly in your ear,Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.PHEBESweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.ROSALINDHe's fallen in love with your foulness and she'llfall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast asshe answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce herwith bitter words. Why look you so upon me?PHEBEFor no ill will I bear you.ROSALINDI pray you, do not fall in love with me,For I am falser than vows made in wine:Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,And be not proud: though all the world could see,None could be so abused in sight as he.Come, to our flock.Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORINPHEBEDead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'SILVIUSSweet Phebe,--PHEBEHa, what say'st thou, Silvius?SILVIUSSweet Phebe, pity me.PHEBEWhy, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.SILVIUSWherever sorrow is, relief would be:If you do sorrow at my grief in love,By giving love your sorrow and my griefWere both extermined.PHEBEThou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?SILVIUSI would have you.PHEBEWhy, that were covetousness.Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,And yet it is not that I bear thee love;But since that thou canst talk of love so well,Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:But do not look for further recompenseThan thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.SILVIUSSo holy and so perfect is my love,And I in such a poverty of grace,That I shall think it a most plenteous cropTo glean the broken ears after the manThat the main harvest reaps: loose now and thenA scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.PHEBEKnow'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?SILVIUSNot very well, but I have met him oft;And he hath bought the cottage and the boundsThat the old carlot once was master of.PHEBEThink not I love him, though I ask for him:'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;But what care I for words? yet words do wellWhen he that speaks them pleases those that hear.It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:He'll make a proper man: the best thing in himIs his complexion; and faster than his tongueDid make offence his eye did heal it up.He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:There was a pretty redness in his lip,A little riper and more lusty redThan that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the differenceBetween the constant red and mingled damask.There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd himIn parcels as I did, would have gone nearTo fall in love with him; but, for my part,I love him not nor hate him not; and yetI have more cause to hate him than to love him:For what had he to do to chide at me?He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:I marvel why I answer'd not again:But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.I'll write to him a very taunting letter,And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?SILVIUSPhebe, with all my heart.PHEBEI'll write it straight;The matter's in my head and in my heart:I will be bitter with him and passing short.Go with me, Silvius.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. The forest.Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUESJAQUESI prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquaintedwith thee.ROSALINDThey say you are a melancholy fellow.JAQUESI am so; I do love it better than laughing.ROSALINDThose that are in extremity of either are abominablefellows and betray themselves to every moderncensure worse than drunkards.JAQUESWhy, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.ROSALINDWhy then, 'tis good to be a post.JAQUESI have neither the scholar's melancholy, which isemulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor thesoldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, northe lover's, which is all these: but it is amelancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry'scontemplation of my travels, in which my oftenrumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.ROSALINDA traveller! By my faith, you have great reason tobe sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to seeother men's; then, to have seen much and to havenothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.JAQUESYes, I have gained my experience.ROSALINDAnd your experience makes you sad: I had rather havea fool to make me merry than experience to make mesad; and to travel for it too!Enter ORLANDOORLANDOGood day and happiness, dear Rosalind!JAQUESNay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.ExitROSALINDFarewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp andwear strange suits, disable all the benefits of yourown country, be out of love with your nativity andalmost chide God for making you that countenance youare, or I will scarce think you have swam in agondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you beenall this while? You a lover! An you serve me suchanother trick, never come in my sight more.ORLANDOMy fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.ROSALINDBreak an hour's promise in love! He that willdivide a minute into a thousand parts and break buta part of the thousandth part of a minute in theaffairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupidhath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warranthim heart-whole.ORLANDOPardon me, dear Rosalind.ROSALINDNay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: Ihad as lief be wooed of a snail.ORLANDOOf a snail?ROSALINDAy, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, hecarries his house on his head; a better jointure,I think, than you make a woman: besides he bringshis destiny with him.ORLANDOWhat's that?ROSALINDWhy, horns, which such as you are fain to bebeholding to your wives for: but he comes armed inhis fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.ORLANDOVirtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.ROSALINDAnd I am your Rosalind.CELIAIt pleases him to call you so; but he hath aRosalind of a better leer than you.ROSALINDCome, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holidayhumour and like enough to consent. What would yousay to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?ORLANDOI would kiss before I spoke.ROSALINDNay, you were better speak first, and when you weregravelled for lack of matter, you might takeoccasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they areout, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--Godwarn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.ORLANDOHow if the kiss be denied?ROSALINDThen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.ORLANDOWho could be out, being before his beloved mistress?ROSALINDMarry, that should you, if I were your mistress, orI should think my honesty ranker than my wit.ORLANDOWhat, of my suit?ROSALINDNot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.Am not I your Rosalind?ORLANDOI take some joy to say you are, because I would betalking of her.ROSALINDWell in her person I say I will not have you.ORLANDOThen in mine own person I die.ROSALINDNo, faith, die by attorney. The poor world isalmost six thousand years old, and in all this timethere was not any man died in his own person,videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brainsdashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what hecould to die before, and he is one of the patternsof love. Leander, he would have lived many a fairyear, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not beenfor a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he wentbut forth to wash him in the Hellespont and beingtaken with the cramp was drowned and the foolishcoroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'But these are all lies: men have died from time totime and worms have eaten them, but not for love.ORLANDOI would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,for, I protest, her frown might kill me.ROSALINDBy this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, nowI will be your Rosalind in a more coming-ondisposition, and ask me what you will. I will grantit.ORLANDOThen love me, Rosalind.ROSALINDYes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.ORLANDOAnd wilt thou have me?ROSALINDAy, and twenty such.ORLANDOWhat sayest thou?ROSALINDAre you not good?ORLANDOI hope so.ROSALINDWhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing?Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?ORLANDOPray thee, marry us.CELIAI cannot say the words.ROSALINDYou must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'CELIAGo to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?ORLANDOI will.ROSALINDAy, but when?ORLANDOWhy now; as fast as she can marry us.ROSALINDThen you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'ORLANDOI take thee, Rosalind, for wife.ROSALINDI might ask you for your commission; but I do takethee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goesbefore the priest; and certainly a woman's thoughtruns before her actions.ORLANDOSo do all thoughts; they are winged.ROSALINDNow tell me how long you would have her after youhave possessed her.ORLANDOFor ever and a day.ROSALINDSay 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;men are April when they woo, December when they wed:maids are May when they are maids, but the skychanges when they are wives. I will be more jealousof thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,more clamorous than a parrot against rain, morenew-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desiresthan a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Dianain the fountain, and I will do that when you aredisposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, andthat when thou art inclined to sleep.ORLANDOBut will my Rosalind do so?ROSALINDBy my life, she will do as I do.ORLANDOO, but she is wise.ROSALINDOr else she could not have the wit to do this: thewiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman'swit and it will out at the casement; shut that and'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill flywith the smoke out at the chimney.ORLANDOA man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say'Wit, whither wilt?'ROSALINDNay, you might keep that cheque for it till you metyour wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.ORLANDOAnd what wit could wit have to excuse that?ROSALINDMarry, to say she came to seek you there. You shallnever take her without her answer, unless you takeher without her tongue. O, that woman that cannotmake her fault her husband's occasion, let hernever nurse her child herself, for she will breedit like a fool!ORLANDOFor these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.ROSALINDAlas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.ORLANDOI must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock Iwill be with thee again.ROSALINDAy, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what youwould prove: my friends told me as much, and Ithought no less: that flattering tongue of yourswon me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,death! Two o'clock is your hour?ORLANDOAy, sweet Rosalind.ROSALINDBy my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mendme, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,if you break one jot of your promise or come oneminute behind your hour, I will think you the mostpathetical break-promise and the most hollow loverand the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind thatmay be chosen out of the gross band of theunfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keepyour promise.ORLANDOWith no less religion than if thou wert indeed myRosalind: so adieu.ROSALINDWell, Time is the old justice that examines all suchoffenders, and let Time try: adieu.Exit ORLANDOCELIAYou have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:we must have your doublet and hose plucked over yourhead, and show the world what the bird hath done toher own nest.ROSALINDO coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thoudidst know how many fathom deep I am in love! Butit cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknownbottom, like the bay of Portugal.CELIAOr rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pouraffection in, it runs out.ROSALINDNo, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begotof thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyesbecause his own are out, let him be judge how deep Iam in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be outof the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow andsigh till he come.CELIAAnd I'll sleep.ExeuntSCENE II. The forest.Enter JAQUES, Lords, and ForestersJAQUESWhich is he that killed the deer?A LordSir, it was I.JAQUESLet's present him to the duke, like a Romanconqueror; and it would do well to set the deer'shorns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Haveyou no song, forester, for this purpose?ForesterYes, sir.JAQUESSing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so itmake noise enough.SONG.ForesterWhat shall he have that kill'd the deer?His leather skin and horns to wear.Then sing him home;The rest shall bear this burdenTake thou no scorn to wear the horn;It was a crest ere thou wast born:Thy father's father wore it,And thy father bore it:The horn, the horn, the lusty hornIs not a thing to laugh to scorn.ExeuntSCENE III. The forest.Enter ROSALIND and CELIAROSALINDHow say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? andhere much Orlando!CELIAI warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, hehath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth tosleep. Look, who comes here.Enter SILVIUSSILVIUSMy errand is to you, fair youth;My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:I know not the contents; but, as I guessBy the stern brow and waspish actionWhich she did use as she was writing of it,It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:I am but as a guiltless messenger.ROSALINDPatience herself would startle at this letterAnd play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,This is a letter of your own device.SILVIUSNo, I protest, I know not the contents:Phebe did write it.ROSALINDCome, come, you are a foolAnd turn'd into the extremity of love.I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did thinkThat her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:I say she never did invent this letter;This is a man's invention and his hand.SILVIUSSure, it is hers.ROSALINDWhy, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brainCould not drop forth such giant-rude inventionSuch Ethiope words, blacker in their effectThan in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?SILVIUSSo please you, for I never heard it yet;Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.ROSALINDShe Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.ReadsArt thou god to shepherd turn'd,That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?Can a woman rail thus?SILVIUSCall you this railing?ROSALIND[Reads]Why, thy godhead laid apart,Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?Did you ever hear such railing?Whiles the eye of man did woo me,That could do no vengeance to me.Meaning me a beast.If the scorn of your bright eyneHave power to raise such love in mine,Alack, in me what strange effectWould they work in mild aspect!Whiles you chid me, I did love;How then might your prayers move!He that brings this love to theeLittle knows this love in me:And by him seal up thy mind;Whether that thy youth and kindWill the faithful offer takeOf me and all that I can make;Or else by him my love deny,And then I'll study how to die.SILVIUSCall you this chiding?CELIAAlas, poor shepherd!ROSALINDDo you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wiltthou love such a woman? What, to make thee aninstrument and play false strains upon thee! not tobe endured! Well, go your way to her, for I seelove hath made thee a tame snake, and say this toher: that if she love me, I charge her to lovethee; if she will not, I will never have her unlessthou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.Exit SILVIUSEnter OLIVEROLIVERGood morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,Where in the purlieus of this forest standsA sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?CELIAWest of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:The rank of osiers by the murmuring streamLeft on your right hand brings you to the place.But at this hour the house doth keep itself;There's none within.OLIVERIf that an eye may profit by a tongue,Then should I know you by description;Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,Of female favour, and bestows himselfLike a ripe sister: the woman lowAnd browner than her brother.' Are not youThe owner of the house I did inquire for?CELIAIt is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.OLIVEROrlando doth commend him to you both,And to that youth he calls his RosalindHe sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?ROSALINDI am: what must we understand by this?OLIVERSome of my shame; if you will know of meWhat man I am, and how, and why, and whereThis handkercher was stain'd.CELIAI pray you, tell it.OLIVERWhen last the young Orlando parted from youHe left a promise to return againWithin an hour, and pacing through the forest,Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,And mark what object did present itself:Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with ageAnd high top bald with dry antiquity,A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,Lay sleeping on his back: about his neckA green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,Who with her head nimble in threats approach'dThe opening of his mouth; but suddenly,Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,And with indented glides did slip awayInto a bush: under which bush's shadeA lioness, with udders all drawn dry,Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tisThe royal disposition of that beastTo prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:This seen, Orlando did approach the manAnd found it was his brother, his elder brother.CELIAO, I have heard him speak of that same brother;And he did render him the most unnaturalThat lived amongst men.OLIVERAnd well he might so do,For well I know he was unnatural.ROSALINDBut, to Orlando: did he leave him there,Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?OLIVERTwice did he turn his back and purposed so;But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,And nature, stronger than his just occasion,Made him give battle to the lioness,Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtlingFrom miserable slumber I awaked.CELIAAre you his brother?ROSALINDWast you he rescued?CELIAWas't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?OLIVER'Twas I; but 'tis not I	I do not shameTo tell you what I was, since my conversionSo sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.ROSALINDBut, for the bloody napkin?OLIVERBy and by.When from the first to last betwixt us twoTears our recountments had most kindly bathed,As how I came into that desert place:--In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,Committing me unto my brother's love;Who led me instantly unto his cave,There stripp'd himself, and here upon his armThe lioness had torn some flesh away,Which all this while had bled; and now he faintedAnd cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;And, after some small space, being strong at heart,He sent me hither, stranger as I am,To tell this story, that you might excuseHis broken promise, and to give this napkinDyed in his blood unto the shepherd youthThat he in sport doth call his Rosalind.ROSALIND swoonsCELIAWhy, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!OLIVERMany will swoon when they do look on blood.CELIAThere is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!OLIVERLook, he recovers.ROSALINDI would I were at home.CELIAWe'll lead you thither.I pray you, will you take him by the arm?OLIVERBe of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack aman's heart.ROSALINDI do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body wouldthink this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tellyour brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!OLIVERThis was not counterfeit: there is too greattestimony in your complexion that it was a passionof earnest.ROSALINDCounterfeit, I assure you.OLIVERWell then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.ROSALINDSo I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.CELIACome, you look paler and paler: pray you, drawhomewards. Good sir, go with us.OLIVERThat will I, for I must bear answer backHow you excuse my brother, Rosalind.ROSALINDI shall devise something: but, I pray you, commendmy counterfeiting to him. Will you go?ExeuntACT VSCENE I.

Art thou wise?WILLIAMAy, sir, I have a pretty wit.TOUCHSTONEWhy, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise manknows himself to be a fool.' The heathenphilosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat andlips to open. You do love this maid?WILLIAMI do, sir.TOUCHSTONEGive me your hand. Art thou learned?WILLIAMNo, sir.TOUCHSTONEThen learn this of me: to have, is to have; for itis a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured outof a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth emptythe other; for all your writers do consent that ipseis he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.WILLIAMWhich he, sir?TOUCHSTONEHe, sir, that must marry this woman.

The forest.Enter ORLANDO and OLIVERORLANDOIs't possible that on so little acquaintance youshould like her? that but seeing you should loveher? and loving woo? and, wooing, she shouldgrant? and will you persever to enjoy her?OLIVERNeither call the giddiness of it in question, thepoverty of her, the small acquaintance, my suddenwooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;consent with both that we may enjoy each other: itshall be to your good; for my father's house and allthe revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will Iestate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.ORLANDOYou have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:thither will I invite the duke and all's contentedfollowers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for lookyou, here comes my Rosalind.Enter ROSALINDROSALINDGod save you, brother.OLIVERAnd you, fair sister.ExitROSALINDO, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see theewear thy heart in a scarf!ORLANDOIt is my arm.ROSALINDI thought thy heart had been wounded with the clawsof a lion.ORLANDOWounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.ROSALINDDid your brother tell you how I counterfeited toswoon when he showed me your handkerchief?ORLANDOAy, and greater wonders than that.ROSALINDO, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there wasnever any thing so sudden but the fight of two ramsand Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, andovercame:' for your brother and my sister no soonermet but they looked, no sooner looked but theyloved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no soonersighed but they asked one another the reason, nosooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairsto marriage which they will climb incontinent, orelse be incontinent before marriage: they are inthe very wrath of love and they will together; clubscannot part them.ORLANDOThey shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid theduke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing itis to look into happiness through another man'seyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be atthe height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shallthink my brother happy in having what he wishes for.ROSALINDWhy then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?ORLANDOI can live no longer by thinking.ROSALINDI will weary you then no longer with idle talking.Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: Ispeak not this that you should bear a good opinionof my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may insome little measure draw a belief from you, to doyourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, ifyou please, that I can do strange things: I have,since I was three year old, conversed with amagician, most profound in his art and yet notdamnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heartas your gesture cries it out, when your brothermarries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know intowhat straits of fortune she is driven; and it isnot impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenientto you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow humanas she is and without any danger.ORLANDOSpeakest thou in sober meanings?ROSALINDBy my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though Isay I am a magician. Therefore, put you in yourbest array: bid your friends; for if you will bemarried to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.Enter SILVIUS and PHEBELook, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.PHEBEYouth, you have done me much ungentleness,To show the letter that I writ to you.ROSALINDI care not if I have: it is my studyTo seem despiteful and ungentle to you:You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;Look upon him, love him; he worships you.PHEBEGood shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.SILVIUSIt is to be all made of sighs and tears;And so am I for Phebe.PHEBEAnd I for Ganymede.ORLANDOAnd I for Rosalind.ROSALINDAnd I for no woman.SILVIUSIt is to be all made of faith and service;And so am I for Phebe.PHEBEAnd I for Ganymede.ORLANDOAnd I for Rosalind.ROSALINDAnd I for no woman.SILVIUSIt is to be all made of fantasy,All made of passion and all made of wishes,All adoration, duty, and observance,All humbleness, all patience and impatience,All purity, all trial, all observance;And so am I for Phebe.PHEBEAnd so am I for Ganymede.ORLANDOAnd so am I for Rosalind.ROSALINDAnd so am I for no woman.PHEBEIf this be so, why blame you me to love you?SILVIUSIf this be so, why blame you me to love you?ORLANDOIf this be so, why blame you me to love you?ROSALINDWho do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'ORLANDOTo her that is not here, nor doth not hear.ROSALINDPray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howlingof Irish wolves against the moon.To SILVIUSI will help you, if I can:To PHEBEI would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.To PHEBEI will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll bemarried to-morrow:To ORLANDOI will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and youshall be married to-morrow:To SILVIUSI will content you, if what pleases you contentsyou, and you shall be married to-morrow.To ORLANDOAs you love Rosalind, meet:To SILVIUSas you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,I'll meet.

Here comes a pair ofvery strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.TOUCHSTONESalutation and greeting to you all!JAQUESGood my lord, bid him welcome: this is themotley-minded gentleman that I have so often met inthe forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.TOUCHSTONEIf any man doubt that, let him put me to mypurgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattereda lady; I have been politic with my friend, smoothwith mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I havehad four quarrels, and like to have fought one.JAQUESAnd how was that ta'en up?TOUCHSTONEFaith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon theseventh cause.JAQUESHow seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.DUKE SENIORI like him very well.TOUCHSTONEGod 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. Ipress in here, sir, amongst the rest of the countrycopulatives, to swear and to forswear: according asmarriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poorhumour of mine, sir, to take that that no man elsewill: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in apoor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.DUKE SENIORBy my faith, he is very swift and sententious.TOUCHSTONEAccording to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.JAQUESBut, for the seventh cause; how did you find thequarrel on the seventh cause?TOUCHSTONEUpon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body moreseeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike thecut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in themind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' hewould send me word, he cut it to please himself:this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it wasnot well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this iscalled the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was notwell cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: thisis called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was notwell cut,' he would say I lied: this is called theCounter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the LieCircumstantial and the Lie Direct.JAQUESAnd how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?TOUCHSTONEI durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so wemeasured swords and parted.JAQUESCan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?TOUCHSTONEO sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you havebooks for good manners: I will name you the degrees.The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, theQuip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; thefourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, theCountercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie withCircumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. Allthese you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you mayavoid that too, with an If. I knew when sevenjustices could not take up a quarrel, but when theparties were met themselves, one of them thought butof an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' andthey shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is theonly peacemaker; much virtue in If.JAQUESIs not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good atany thing and yet a fool.DUKE SENIORHe uses his folly like a stalking-horse and underthe presentation of that he shoots his wit.Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIAStill MusicHYMENThen is there mirth in heaven,When earthly things made evenAtone together.Good duke, receive thy daughterHymen from heaven brought her,Yea, brought her hither,That thou mightst join her hand with hisWhose heart within his bosom is.ROSALIND[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.To ORLANDOTo you I give myself, for I am yours.DUKE SENIORIf there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.ORLANDOIf there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.PHEBEIf sight and shape be true,Why then, my love adieu!ROSALINDI'll have no father, if you be not he:I'll have no husband, if you be not he:Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.HYMENPeace, ho!

This to be true,I do engage my life.DUKE SENIORWelcome, young man;Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:To one his lands withheld, and to the otherA land itself at large, a potent dukedom.First, in this forest, let us do those endsThat here were well begun and well begot:And after, every of this happy numberThat have endured shrewd days and nights with usShall share the good of our returned fortune,According to the measure of their states.Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignityAnd fall into our rustic revelry.Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.JAQUESSir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,The duke hath put on a religious lifeAnd thrown into neglect the pompous court?JAQUES DE BOYSHe hath.JAQUESTo him will I : out of these convertitesThere is much matter to be heard and learn'd.To DUKE SENIORYou to your former honour I bequeath;Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:To ORLANDOYou to a love that your true faith doth merit:To OLIVERYou to your land and love and great allies:To SILVIUSYou to a long and well-deserved bed:To TOUCHSTONEAnd you to wrangling; for thy loving voyageIs but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:I am for other than for dancing measures.DUKE SENIORStay, Jaques, stay.JAQUESTo see no pastime I	what you would haveI'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.ExitDUKE SENIORProceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.A danceEPILOGUEROSALINDIt is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lordthe prologue. If it be true that good wine needsno bush, 'tis true that a good play needs noepilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,and good plays prove the better by the help of goodepilogues. What a case am I in then, that amneither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate withyou in the behalf of a good play! I am notfurnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will notbecome me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll beginwith the women. I charge you, O women, for the loveyou bear to men, to like as much of this play asplease you: and I charge you, O men, for the loveyou bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,none of you hates them--that between you and thewomen the play may please. If I were a woman Iwould kiss as many of you as had beards that pleasedme, complexions that liked me and breaths that Idefied not: and, I am sure, as many as have goodbeards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for mykind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.Exeunt
