ACT ISCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAINFERDINANDLet fame, that all hunt after in their lives,Live register'd upon our brazen tombsAnd then grace us in the disgrace of death;When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,The endeavor of this present breath may buyThat honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edgeAnd make us heirs of all eternity.Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,That war against your own affectionsAnd the huge army of the world's desires,--Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;Our court shall be a little Academe,Still and contemplative in living art.You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,Have sworn for three years' term to live with meMy fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutesThat are recorded in this schedule here:Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,That his own hand may strike his honour downThat violates the smallest branch herein:If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.LONGAVILLEI am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bitsMake rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.DUMAINMy loving lord, Dumain is mortified:The grosser manner of these world's delightsHe throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;With all these living in philosophy.BIRONI can but say their protestation over;So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,That is, to live and study here three years.But there are other strict observances;As, not to see a woman in that term,Which I hope well is not enrolled there;And one day in a week to touch no foodAnd but one meal on every day beside,The which I hope is not enrolled there;And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,And not be seen to wink of all the day--When I was wont to think no harm all nightAnd make a dark night too of half the day--Which I hope well is not enrolled there:O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!FERDINANDYour oath is pass'd to pass away from these.BIRONLet me say no, my liege, an if you please:I only swore to study with your graceAnd stay here in your court for three years' space.LONGAVILLEYou swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.BIRONBy yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.What is the end of study? let me know.FERDINANDWhy, that to know, which else we should not know.BIRONThings hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?FERDINANDAy, that is study's godlike recompense.BIRONCome on, then; I will swear to study so,To know the thing I am forbid to know:As thus,--to study where I well may dine,When I to feast expressly am forbid;Or study where to meet some mistress fine,When mistresses from common sense are hid;Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,Study to break it and not break my troth.If study's gain be thus and this be so,Study knows that which yet it doth not know:Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.FERDINANDThese be the stops that hinder study quiteAnd train our intellects to vain delight.BIRONWhy, all delights are vain; but that most vain,Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:As, painfully to pore upon a bookTo seek the light of truth; while truth the whileDoth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.Study me how to please the eye indeedBy fixing it upon a fairer eye,Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heedAnd give him light that it was blinded by.Study is like the heaven's glorious sunThat will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:Small have continual plodders ever wonSave base authority from others' booksThese earthly godfathers of heaven's lightsThat give a name to every fixed starHave no more profit of their shining nightsThan those that walk and wot not what they are.Too much to know is to know nought but fame;And every godfather can give a name.FERDINANDHow well he's read, to reason against reading!DUMAINProceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!LONGAVILLEHe weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.BIRONThe spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.DUMAINHow follows that?BIRONFit in his place and time.DUMAINIn reason nothing.BIRONSomething then in rhyme.FERDINANDBiron is like an envious sneaping frost,That bites the first-born infants of the spring.BIRONWell, say I am; why should proud summer boastBefore the birds have any cause to sing?Why should I joy in any abortive birth?At Christmas I no more desire a roseThan wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;But like of each thing that in season grows.So you, to study now it is too late,Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.FERDINANDWell, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.BIRONNo, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:And though I have for barbarism spoke moreThan for that angel knowledge you can say,Yet confident I'll keep what I have sworeAnd bide the penance of each three years' day.Give me the paper; let me read the same;And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.FERDINANDHow well this yielding rescues thee from shame!BIRON[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within amile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?LONGAVILLEFour days ago.BIRONLet's see the penalty.Reads'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?LONGAVILLEMarry, that did I.BIRONSweet lord, and why?LONGAVILLETo fright them hence with that dread penalty.BIRONA dangerous law against gentility!Reads'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a womanwithin the term of three years, he shall endure suchpublic shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'This article, my liege, yourself must break;For well you know here comes in embassyThe French king's daughter with yourself to speak--A maid of grace and complete majesty--About surrender up of AquitaineTo her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:Therefore this article is made in vain,Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.FERDINANDWhat say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.BIRONSo study evermore is overshot:While it doth study to have what it wouldIt doth forget to do the thing it should,And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.FERDINANDWe must of force dispense with this decree;She must lie here on mere necessity.BIRONNecessity will make us all forswornThree thousand times within this three years' space;For every man with his affects is born,Not by might master'd but by special grace:If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'So to the laws at large I write my name:SubscribesAnd he that breaks them in the least degreeStands in attainder of eternal shame:Suggestions are to other as to me;But I believe, although I seem so loath,I am the last that will last keep his oath.But is there no quick recreation granted?FERDINANDAy, that there is. Our court, you know, is hauntedWith a refined traveller of Spain;A man in all the world's new fashion planted,That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;One whom the music of his own vain tongueDoth ravish like enchanting harmony;A man of complements, whom right and wrongHave chose as umpire of their mutiny:This child of fancy, that Armado hight,For interim to our studies shall relateIn high-born words the worth of many a knightFrom tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;But, I protest, I love to hear him lieAnd I will use him for my minstrelsy.BIRONArmado is a most illustrious wight,A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.LONGAVILLECostard the swain and he shall be our sport;And so to study, three years is but short.Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARDDULLWhich is the duke's own person?BIRONThis, fellow: what wouldst?DULLI myself reprehend his own person, for I am hisgrace's tharborough: but I would see his own personin flesh and blood.BIRONThis is he.DULLSignior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villanyabroad: this letter will tell you more.COSTARDSir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.FERDINANDA letter from the magnificent Armado.BIRONHow low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.LONGAVILLEA high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!BIRONTo hear? or forbear laughing?LONGAVILLETo hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or toforbear both.BIRONWell, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause toclimb in the merriness.COSTARDThe matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.BIRONIn what manner?COSTARDIn manner and form following, sir; all those three:I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting withher upon the form, and taken following her into thepark; which, put together, is in manner and formfollowing. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is themanner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--in some form.BIRONFor the following, sir?COSTARDAs it shall follow in my correction: and God defendthe right!FERDINANDWill you hear this letter with attention?BIRONAs we would hear an oracle.COSTARDSuch is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.FERDINAND[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent andsole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,and body's fostering patron.'COSTARDNot a word of Costard yet.FERDINAND[Reads]  'So it is,'--COSTARDIt may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, intelling true, but so.FERDINANDPeace!COSTARDBe to me and every man that dares not fight!FERDINANDNo words!COSTARDOf other men's secrets, I beseech you.FERDINAND[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-colouredmelancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humourto the most wholesome physic of thy health-givingair; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself towalk. The time when. About the sixth hour; whenbeasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit downto that nourishment which is called supper: so muchfor the time when.

Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,have sent to thee, to receive the meed ofpunishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, AnthonyDull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, andestimation.'DULL'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.FERDINAND[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vesselcalled which I apprehended with the aforesaidswain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bringher to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devotedand heart-burning heat of duty.DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'BIRONThis is not so well as I looked for, but the bestthat ever I heard.FERDINANDAy, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what sayyou to this?COSTARDSir, I confess the wench.FERDINANDDid you hear the proclamation?COSTARDI do confess much of the hearing it but little ofthe marking of it.FERDINANDIt was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be takenwith a wench.COSTARDI was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.FERDINANDWell, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'COSTARDThis was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.FERDINANDIt is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'COSTARDIf it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.FERDINANDThis maid will not serve your turn, sir.COSTARDThis maid will serve my turn, sir.FERDINANDSir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fasta week with bran and water.COSTARDI had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.FERDINANDAnd Don Armado shall be your keeper.My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:And go we, lords, to put in practise thatWhich each to other hath so strongly sworn.Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAINBIRONI'll lay my head to any good man's hat,These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.Sirrah, come on.COSTARDI suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I wastaken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a truegirl; and therefore welcome the sour cup ofprosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; andtill then, sit thee down, sorrow!ExeuntLOVE'S LABOURS LOSTSCENE II.

I pretty, and my saying apt? orI apt, and my saying pretty?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOThou pretty, because little.MOTHLittle pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOAnd therefore apt, because quick.MOTHSpeak you this in my praise, master?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOIn thy condign praise.MOTHI will praise an eel with the same praise.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOWhat, that an eel is ingenious?MOTHThat an eel is quick.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.MOTHI am answered, sir.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI love not to be crossed.MOTH[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI have promised to study three years with the duke.MOTHYou may do it in an hour, sir.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOImpossible.MOTHHow many is one thrice told?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.MOTHYou are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI confess both: they are both the varnish of acomplete man.MOTHThen, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum ofdeuce-ace amounts to.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOIt doth amount to one more than two.MOTHWhich the base vulgar do call three.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOTrue.MOTHWhy, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now hereis three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and howeasy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' andstudy three years in two words, the dancing horsewill tell you.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOA most fine figure!MOTHTo prove you a cipher.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it isbase for a soldier to love, so am I in love with abase wench. If drawing my sword against the humourof affection would deliver me from the reprobatethought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, andransom him to any French courtier for a new-devisedcourtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I shouldoutswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great menhave been in love?MOTHHercules, master.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOMost sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, namemore; and, sweet my child, let them be men of goodrepute and carriage.MOTHSamson, master: he was a man of good carriage, greatcarriage, for he carried the town-gates on his backlike a porter: and he was in love.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOO well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I doexcel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me incarrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson'slove, my dear Moth?MOTHA woman, master.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOOf what complexion?MOTHOf all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOTell me precisely of what complexion.MOTHOf the sea-water green, sir.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOIs that one of the four complexions?MOTHAs I have read, sir; and the best of them too.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOGreen indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have alove of that colour, methinks Samson had small reasonfor it. He surely affected her for her wit.MOTHIt was so, sir; for she had a green wit.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOMy love is most immaculate white and red.MOTHMost maculate thoughts, master, are masked undersuch colours.DONADRIANO DE ARMADODefine, define, well-educated infant.MOTHMy father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!DONADRIANO DE ARMADOSweet invocation of a child; most pretty andpathetical!MOTHIf she be made of white and red,Her faults will ne'er be known,For blushing cheeks by faults are bredAnd fears by pale white shown:Then if she fear, or be to blame,By this you shall not know,For still her cheeks possess the sameWhich native she doth owe.A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason ofwhite and red.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOIs there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?MOTHThe world was very guilty of such a ballad somethree ages since: but I think now 'tis not to befound; or, if it were, it would neither serve forthe writing nor the tune.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I mayexample my digression by some mighty precedent.Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in thepark with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.MOTH[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love thanmy master.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOSing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.MOTHAnd that's great marvel, loving a light wench.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI say, sing.MOTHForbear till this company be past.Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTADULLSir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costardsafe: and you must suffer him to take no delightnor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: sheis allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI do betray myself with blushing. Maid!JAQUENETTAMan?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI will visit thee at the lodge.JAQUENETTAThat's hereby.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI know where it is situate.JAQUENETTALord, how wise you are!DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI will tell thee wonders.JAQUENETTAWith that face?DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI love thee.JAQUENETTASo I heard you say.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOAnd so, farewell.JAQUENETTAFair weather after you!DULLCome, Jaquenetta, away!Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTADONADRIANO DE ARMADOVillain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thoube pardoned.COSTARDWell, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on afull stomach.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOThou shalt be heavily punished.COSTARDI am more bound to you than your fellows, for theyare but lightly rewarded.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOTake away this villain; shut him up.MOTHCome, you transgressing slave; away!COSTARDLet me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.MOTHNo, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.COSTARDWell, if ever I do see the merry days of desolationthat I have seen, some shall see.MOTHWhat shall some see?COSTARDNay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.It is not for prisoners to be too silent in theirwords; and therefore I will say nothing: I thankGod I have as little patience as another man; andtherefore I can be quiet.Exeunt MOTH and COSTARDDONADRIANO DE ARMADOI do affect the very ground, which is base, whereher shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, whichis basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, whichis a great argument of falsehood, if I love. Andhow can that be true love which is falselyattempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson sotempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet wasSolomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.The first and second cause will not serve my turn;the passado he respects not, the duello he regardsnot: his disgrace is to be called boy; but hisglory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.ExitLOVE'S LABOURS LOSTACT IISCENE I. The same.Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other AttendantsBOYETNow, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:Consider who the king your father sends,To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,To parley with the sole inheritorOf all perfections that a man may owe,Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weightThan Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.Be now as prodigal of all dear graceAs Nature was in making graces dearWhen she did starve the general world besideAnd prodigally gave them all to you.PRINCESSGood Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:I am less proud to hear you tell my worthThan you much willing to be counted wiseIn spending your wit in the praise of mine.But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,You are not ignorant, all-telling fameDoth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,Till painful study shall outwear three years,No woman may approach his silent court:Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,Before we enter his forbidden gates,To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,Bold of your worthiness, we single youAs our best-moving fair solicitor.Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,On serious business, craving quick dispatch,Importunes personal conference with his grace:Haste, signify so much; while we attend,Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.BOYETProud of employment, willingly I go.PRINCESSAll pride is willing pride, and yours is so.Exit BOYETWho are the votaries, my loving lords,That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?First LordLord Longaville is one.PRINCESSKnow you the man?MARIAI know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heirOf Jaques Falconbridge, solemnizedIn Normandy, saw I this Longaville:A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still willsIt should none spare that come within his power.PRINCESSSome merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?MARIAThey say so most that most his humours know.PRINCESSSuch short-lived wits do wither as they grow.Who are the rest?KATHARINEThe young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,And shape to win grace though he had no wit.I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;And much too little of that good I sawIs my report to his great worthiness.ROSALINEAnother of these students at that timeWas there with him, if I have heard a truth.Biron they call him; but a merrier man,Within the limit of becoming mirth,I never spent an hour's talk withal:His eye begets occasion for his wit;For every object that the one doth catchThe other turns to a mirth-moving jest,Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,Delivers in such apt and gracious wordsThat aged ears play truant at his talesAnd younger hearings are quite ravished;So sweet and voluble is his discourse.PRINCESSGod bless my ladies! are they all in love,That every one her own hath garnishedWith such bedecking ornaments of praise?First LordHere comes Boyet.Re-enter BOYETPRINCESSNow, what admittance, lord?BOYETNavarre had notice of your fair approach;And he and his competitors in oathWere all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:He rather means to lodge you in the field,Like one that comes here to besiege his court,Than seek a dispensation for his oath,To let you enter his unpeopled house.Here comes Navarre.Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and AttendantsFERDINANDFair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.PRINCESS'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I havenot yet: the roof of this court is too high to beyours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.FERDINANDYou shall be welcome, madam, to my court.PRINCESSI will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.FERDINANDHear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.PRINCESSOur Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.FERDINANDNot for the world, fair madam, by my will.PRINCESSWhy, will shall break it; will and nothing else.FERDINANDYour ladyship is ignorant what it is.PRINCESSWere my lord so, his ignorance were wise,Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,And sin to break it.But pardon me.

By the Lord, this love is as mad asAjax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:well proved again o' my side! I will not love: ifI do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but hereye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would notlove her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothingin the world but lie, and lie in my throat. Byheaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhymeand to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' mysonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sentit, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeterfool, sweetest lady!

Ill, to example ill,Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;For none offend where all alike do dote.LONGAVILLE[Advancing]  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,To be o'erheard and taken napping so.FERDINAND[Advancing]  Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;You chide at him, offending twice as much;You do not love Maria; LongavilleDid never sonnet for her sake compile,Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwartHis loving bosom to keep down his heart.I have been closely shrouded in this bushAnd mark'd you both and for you both did blush:I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:To LONGAVILLEYou would for paradise break faith, and troth;To DUMAINAnd Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.What will Biron say when that he shall hearFaith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!For all the wealth that ever I did see,I would not have him know so much by me.BIRONNow step I forth to whip hypocrisy.AdvancingAh, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reproveThese worms for loving, that art most in love?Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tearsThere is no certain princess that appears;You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?You found his mote; the king your mote did see;But I a beam do find in each of three.O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!O me, with what strict patience have I sat,To see a king transformed to a gnat!To see great Hercules whipping a gig,And profound Solomon to tune a jig,And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?And where my liege's? all about the breast:A caudle, ho!FERDINANDToo bitter is thy jest.Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?BIRONNot you to me, but I betray'd by you:I, that am honest; I, that hold it sinTo break the vow I am engaged in;I am betray'd, by keeping companyWith men like men of inconstancy.When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?Or groan for love? or spend a minute's timeIn pruning me?

Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,At the first opening of the gorgeous east,Bows not his vassal head and strucken blindKisses the base ground with obedient breast?What peremptory eagle-sighted eyeDares look upon the heaven of her brow,That is not blinded by her majesty?FERDINANDWhat zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;She an attending star, scarce seen a light.BIRONMy eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:O, but for my love, day would turn to night!Of all complexions the cull'd sovereigntyDo meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,Where several worthies make one dignity,Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.FERDINANDBy heaven, thy love is black as ebony.BIRONIs ebony like her? O wood divine!A wife of such wood were felicity.O, who can give an oath? where is a book?That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,If that she learn not of her eye to look:No face is fair that is not full so black.FERDINANDO paradox! Black is the badge of hell,The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.BIRONDevils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,It mourns that painting and usurping hairShould ravish doters with a false aspect;And therefore is she born to make black fair.Her favour turns the fashion of the days,For native blood is counted painting now;And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.DUMAINTo look like her are chimney-sweepers black.LONGAVILLEAnd since her time are colliers counted bright.FERDINANDAnd Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.DUMAINDark needs no candles now, for dark is light.BIRONYour mistresses dare never come in rain,For fear their colours should be wash'd away.FERDINAND'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.BIRONI'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.FERDINANDNo devil will fright thee then so much as she.DUMAINI never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.LONGAVILLELook, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.BIRONO, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!DUMAINO, vile! then, as she goes, what upward liesThe street should see as she walk'd overhead.FERDINANDBut what of this? are we not all in love?BIRONNothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.FERDINANDThen leave this chat; and, good Biron, now proveOur loving lawful, and our faith not torn.DUMAINAy, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.LONGAVILLEO, some authority how to proceed;Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.DUMAINSome salve for perjury.BIRON'Tis more than need.Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.Consider what you first did swear unto,To fast, to study, and to see no woman;Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;And abstinence engenders maladies.And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,In that each of you have forsworn his book,Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,Have found the ground of study's excellenceWithout the beauty of a woman's face?From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;  They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fireWhy, universal plodding poisons upThe nimble spirits in the arteries,As motion and long-during action tiresThe sinewy vigour of the traveller.Now, for not looking on a woman's face,You have in that forsworn the use of eyesAnd study too, the causer of your vow;For where is any author in the worldTeaches such beauty as a woman's eye?Learning is but an adjunct to ourselfAnd where we are our learning likewise is:Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,Do we not likewise see our learning there?O, we have made a vow to study, lords,And in that vow we have forsworn our books.For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,In leaden contemplation have found outSuch fiery numbers as the prompting eyesOf beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;And therefore, finding barren practisers,Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,Lives not alone immured in the brain;But, with the motion of all elements,Courses as swift as thought in every power,And gives to every power a double power,Above their functions and their offices.It adds a precious seeing to the eye;A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:Love's feeling is more soft and sensibleThan are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:For valour, is not Love a Hercules,Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musicalAs bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:And when Love speaks, the voice of all the godsMakes heaven drowsy with the harmony.Never durst poet touch a pen to writeUntil his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;O, then his lines would ravish savage earsAnd plant in tyrants mild humility.From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;They are the books, the arts, the academes,That show, contain and nourish all the world:Else none at all in ought proves excellent.Then fools you were these women to forswear,Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.It is religion to be thus forsworn,For charity itself fulfills the law,And who can sever love from charity?FERDINANDSaint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!BIRONAdvance your standards, and upon them, lords;Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,In conflict that you get the sun of them.LONGAVILLENow to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?FERDINANDAnd win them too: therefore let us deviseSome entertainment for them in their tents.BIRONFirst, from the park let us conduct them thither;Then homeward every man attach the handOf his fair mistress: in the afternoonWe will with some strange pastime solace them,Such as the shortness of the time can shape;For revels, dances, masks and merry hoursForerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.FERDINANDAway, away! no time shall be omittedThat will betime, and may by us be fitted.BIRONAllons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;And justice always whirls in equal measure:Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;If so, our copper buys no better treasure.ExeuntLOVE'S LABOURS LOSTACT VSCENE I.

I did converse this quondam day witha companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.HOLOFERNESNovi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, hisdiscourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eyeambitious, his gait majestical, and his generalbehavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical.

By the world, I recount nofable: some certain special honours it pleaseth hisgreatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man oftravel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I doimplore secrecy,--that the king would have mepresent the princess, sweet chuck, with somedelightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, orantique, or firework.

What are theyThat charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.BOYETUnder the cool shade of a sycamoreI thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,Toward that shade I might behold addrestThe king and his companions: warilyI stole into a neighbour thicket by,And overheard what you shall overhear,That, by and by, disguised they will be here.Their herald is a pretty knavish page,That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:Action and accent did they teach him there;'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'And ever and anon they made a doubtPresence majestical would put him out,'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and sworeA better speech was never spoke before;Another, with his finger and his thumb,Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.With that, they all did tumble on the ground,With such a zealous laughter, so profound,That in this spleen ridiculous appears,To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.PRINCESSBut what, but what, come they to visit us?BOYETThey do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;And every one his love-feat will advanceUnto his several mistress, which they'll knowBy favours several which they did bestow.PRINCESSAnd will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;And not a man of them shall have the grace,Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,And then the king will court thee for his dear;Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.And change your favours too; so shall your lovesWoo contrary, deceived by these removes.ROSALINECome on, then; wear the favours most in sight.KATHARINEBut in this changing what is your intent?PRINCESSThe effect of my intent is to cross theirs:They do it but in mocking merriment;And mock for mock is only my intent.Their several counsels they unbosom shallTo loves mistook, and so be mock'd withalUpon the next occasion that we meet,With visages displayed, to talk and greet.ROSALINEBut shall we dance, if they desire to't?PRINCESSNo, to the death, we will not move a foot;Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.BOYETWhy, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,And quite divorce his memory from his part.PRINCESSTherefore I do it; and I make no doubtThe rest will ne'er come in, if he be outThere's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:So shall we stay, mocking intended game,And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.Trumpets sound withinBOYETThe trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.The Ladies maskEnter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,  BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and maskedMOTHAll hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--BOYETBeauties no richer than rich taffeta.MOTHA holy parcel of the fairest dames.The Ladies turn their backs to himThat ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!BIRON[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!MOTHThat ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--BOYETTrue; out indeed.MOTHOut of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafeNot to behold--BIRON[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.MOTHOnce to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,--with your sun-beamed eyes--BOYETThey will not answer to that epithet;You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'MOTHThey do not mark me, and that brings me out.BIRONIs this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!Exit MOTHROSALINEWhat would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:That some plain man recount their purposesKnow what they would.BOYETWhat would you with the princess?BIRONNothing but peace and gentle visitation.ROSALINEWhat would they, say they?BOYETNothing but peace and gentle visitation.ROSALINEWhy, that they have; and bid them so be gone.BOYETShe says, you have it, and you may be gone.FERDINANDSay to her, we have measured many milesTo tread a measure with her on this grass.BOYETThey say, that they have measured many a mileTo tread a measure with you on this grass.ROSALINEIt is not so.

Fair gentle sweet,Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,By light we lose light: your capacityIs of that nature that to your huge storeWise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.ROSALINEThis proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--BIRONI am a fool, and full of poverty.ROSALINEBut that you take what doth to you belong,It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.BIRONO, I am yours, and all that I possess!ROSALINEAll the fool mine?BIRONI cannot give you less.ROSALINEWhich of the vizards was it that you wore?BIRONWhere? when? what vizard? why demand you this?ROSALINEThere, then, that vizard; that superfluous caseThat hid the worse and show'd the better face.FERDINANDWe are descried; they'll mock us now downright.DUMAINLet us confess and turn it to a jest.PRINCESSAmazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?ROSALINEHelp, hold his brows! he'll swoon!

Rosaline,What did the Russian whisper in your ear?ROSALINEMadam, he swore that he did hold me dearAs precious eyesight, and did value meAbove this world; adding thereto moreoverThat he would wed me, or else die my lover.PRINCESSGod give thee joy of him! the noble lordMost honourably doth unhold his word.FERDINANDWhat mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,I never swore this lady such an oath.ROSALINEBy heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.FERDINANDMy faith and this the princess I did give:I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.PRINCESSPardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.What, will you have me, or your pearl again?BIRONNeither of either; I remit both twain.I see the trick on't: here was a consent,Knowing aforehand of our merriment,To dash it like a Christmas comedy:Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trickTo make my lady laugh when she's disposed,Told our intents before; which once disclosed,The ladies did change favours: and then we,Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.Now, to our perjury to add more terror,We are again forsworn, in will and error.Much upon this it is: and might not youTo BOYETForestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,And laugh upon the apple of her eye?And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.You leer upon me, do you? there's an eyeWounds like a leaden sword.BOYETFull merrilyHath this brave manage, this career, been run.BIRONLo, he is tilting straight!

I thank you, gracious lords,For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafeIn your rich wisdom to excuse or hideThe liberal opposition of our spirits,If over-boldly we have borne ourselvesIn the converse of breath: your gentlenessWas guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:Excuse me so, coming too short of thanksFor my great suit so easily obtain'd.FERDINANDThe extreme parts of time extremely formsAll causes to the purpose of his speed,And often at his very loose decidesThat which long process could not arbitrate:And though the mourning brow of progenyForbid the smiling courtesy of loveThe holy suit which fain it would convince,Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,Let not the cloud of sorrow justle itFrom what it purposed; since, to wail friends lostIs not by much so wholesome-profitableAs to rejoice at friends but newly found.PRINCESSI understand you not: my griefs are double.BIRONHonest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;And by these badges understand the king.For your fair sakes have we neglected time,Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humoursEven to the opposed end of our intents:And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--As love is full of unbefitting strains,All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,Varying in subjects as the eye doth rollTo every varied object in his glance:Which parti-coated presence of loose lovePut on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,Our love being yours, the error that love makesIs likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,By being once false for ever to be trueTo those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.PRINCESSWe have received your letters full of love;Your favours, the ambassadors of love;And, in our maiden council, rated themAt courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,As bombast and as lining to the time:But more devout than this in our respectsHave we not been; and therefore met your lovesIn their own fashion, like a merriment.DUMAINOur letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.LONGAVILLESo did our looks.ROSALINEWe did not quote them so.FERDINANDNow, at the latest minute of the hour,Grant us your loves.PRINCESSA time, methinks, too shortTo make a world-without-end bargain in.No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:If for my love, as there is no such cause,You will do aught, this shall you do for me:Your oath I will not trust; but go with speedTo some forlorn and naked hermitage,Remote from all the pleasures of the world;There stay until the twelve celestial signsHave brought about the annual reckoning.If this austere insociable lifeChange not your offer made in heat of blood;If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weedsNip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,But that it bear this trial and last love;Then, at the expiration of the year,Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,And, by this virgin palm now kissing thineI will be thine; and till that instant shutMy woeful self up in a mourning house,Raining the tears of lamentationFor the remembrance of my father's death.If this thou do deny, let our hands part,Neither entitled in the other's heart.FERDINANDIf this, or more than this, I would deny,To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.DUMAINBut what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?KATHARINEA beard, fair health, and honesty;With three-fold love I wish you all these three.DUMAINO, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?KATHARINENot so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a dayI'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:Come when the king doth to my lady come;Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.DUMAINI'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.KATHARINEYet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.LONGAVILLEWhat says Maria?MARIAAt the twelvemonth's endI'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.LONGAVILLEI'll stay with patience; but the time is long.MARIAThe liker you; few taller are so young.BIRONStudies my lady? mistress, look on me;Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,What humble suit attends thy answer there:Impose some service on me for thy love.ROSALINEOft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,Before I saw you; and the world's large tongueProclaims you for a man replete with mocks,Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,Which you on all estates will executeThat lie within the mercy of your wit.To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,And therewithal to win me, if you please,Without the which I am not to be won,You shall this twelvemonth term from day to dayVisit the speechless sick and still converseWith groaning wretches; and your task shall be,With all the fierce endeavor of your witTo enforce the pained impotent to smile.BIRONTo move wild laughter in the throat of death?It cannot be; it is impossible:Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.ROSALINEWhy, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,Whose influence is begot of that loose graceWhich shallow laughing hearers give to fools:A jest's prosperity lies in the earOf him that hears it, never in the tongueOf him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,And I will have you and that fault withal;But if they will not, throw away that spirit,And I shall find you empty of that fault,Right joyful of your reformation.BIRONA twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.PRINCESS[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.FERDINANDNo, madam; we will bring you on your way.BIRONOur wooing doth not end like an old play;Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesyMight well have made our sport a comedy.FERDINANDCome, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,And then 'twill end.BIRONThat's too long for a play.Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADODONADRIANO DE ARMADOSweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--PRINCESSWas not that Hector?DUMAINThe worthy knight of Troy.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOI will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I ama votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold theplough for her sweet love three years. But, mostesteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue thatthe two learned men have compiled in praise of theowl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in theend of our show.FERDINANDCall them forth quickly; we will do so.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOHolla! approach.Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD, and othersThis side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;the one maintained by the owl, the other by thecuckoo. Ver, begin.THE SONGSPRING.When daisies pied and violets blueAnd lady-smocks all silver-whiteAnd cuckoo-buds of yellow hueDo paint the meadows with delight,The cuckoo then, on every tree,Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,Unpleasing to a married ear!When shepherds pipe on oaten strawsAnd merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,And maidens bleach their summer smocksThe cuckoo then, on every tree,Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,Unpleasing to a married ear!WINTER.When icicles hang by the wallAnd Dick the shepherd blows his nailAnd Tom bears logs into the hallAnd milk comes frozen home in pail,When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;Tu-who, a merry note,While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.When all aloud the wind doth blowAnd coughing drowns the parson's sawAnd birds sit brooding in the snowAnd Marian's nose looks red and raw,When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;Tu-who, a merry note,While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.DONADRIANO DE ARMADOThe words of Mercury are harsh after the songs ofApollo. You that way: we this way.Exeunt
