ACT IPROLOGUEEnter ChorusChorusO for a Muse of fire, that would ascendThe brightest heaven of invention,A kingdom for a stage, princes to actAnd monarchs to behold the swelling scene!Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fireCrouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,The flat unraised spirits that have daredOn this unworthy scaffold to bring forthSo great an object: can this cockpit holdThe vasty fields of France? or may we cramWithin this wooden O the very casquesThat did affright the air at Agincourt?O, pardon! since a crooked figure mayAttest in little place a million;And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,On your imaginary forces work.Suppose within the girdle of these wallsAre now confined two mighty monarchies,Whose high upreared and abutting frontsThe perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;Into a thousand parts divide on man,And make imaginary puissance;Think when we talk of horses, that you see themPrinting their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,Turning the accomplishment of many yearsInto an hour-glass: for the which supply,Admit me Chorus to this history;Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.ExitSCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELYCANTERBURYMy lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reignWas like, and had indeed against us pass'd,But that the scambling and unquiet timeDid push it out of farther question.ELYBut how, my lord, shall we resist it now?CANTERBURYIt must be thought on. If it pass against us,We lose the better half of our possession:For all the temporal lands which men devoutBy testament have given to the churchWould they strip from us; being valued thus:As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;And, to relief of lazars and weak age,Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.A hundred almshouses right well supplied;And to the coffers of the king beside,A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.ELYThis would drink deep.CANTERBURY'Twould drink the cup and all.ELYBut what prevention?CANTERBURYThe king is full of grace and fair regard.ELYAnd a true lover of the holy church.CANTERBURYThe courses of his youth promised it not.The breath no sooner left his father's body,But that his wildness, mortified in him,Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very momentConsideration, like an angel, cameAnd whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,Leaving his body as a paradise,To envelop and contain celestial spirits.Never was such a sudden scholar made;Never came reformation in a flood,With such a heady currance, scouring faultsNor never Hydra-headed wilfulnessSo soon did lose his seat and all at onceAs in this king.ELYWe are blessed in the change.CANTERBURYHear him but reason in divinity,And all-admiring with an inward wishYou would desire the king were made a prelate:Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,You would say it hath been all in all his study:List his discourse of war, and you shall hearA fearful battle render'd you in music:Turn him to any cause of policy,The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;So that the art and practic part of lifeMust be the mistress to this theoric:Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,Since his addiction was to courses vain,His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,And never noted in him any study,Any retirement, any sequestrationFrom open haunts and popularity.ELYThe strawberry grows underneath the nettleAnd wholesome berries thrive and ripen bestNeighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:And so the prince obscured his contemplationUnder the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.CANTERBURYIt must be so; for miracles are ceased;And therefore we must needs admit the meansHow things are perfected.ELYBut, my good lord,How now for mitigation of this billUrged by the commons? Doth his majestyIncline to it, or no?CANTERBURYHe seems indifferent,Or rather swaying more upon our partThan cherishing the exhibiters against us;For I have made an offer to his majesty,Upon our spiritual convocationAnd in regard of causes now in hand,Which I have open'd to his grace at large,As touching France, to give a greater sumThan ever at one time the clergy yetDid to his predecessors part withal.ELYHow did this offer seem received, my lord?CANTERBURYWith good acceptance of his majesty;Save that there was not time enough to hear,As I perceived his grace would fain have done,The severals and unhidden passagesOf his true titles to some certain dukedomsAnd generally to the crown and seat of FranceDerived from Edward, his great-grandfather.ELYWhat was the impediment that broke this off?CANTERBURYThe French ambassador upon that instantCraved audience; and the hour, I think, is comeTo give him hearing: is it four o'clock?ELYIt is.CANTERBURYThen go we in, to know his embassy;Which I could with a ready guess declare,Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.ELYI'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.ExeuntSCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and AttendantsKING HENRY VWhere is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?EXETERNot here in presence.KING HENRY VSend for him, good uncle.WESTMORELANDShall we call in the ambassador, my liege?KING HENRY VNot yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,Before we hear him, of some things of weightThat task our thoughts, concerning us and France.Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELYCANTERBURYGod and his angels guard your sacred throneAnd make you long become it!KING HENRY VSure, we thank you.My learned lord, we pray you to proceedAnd justly and religiously unfoldWhy the law Salique that they have in FranceOr should, or should not, bar us in our claim:And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,Or nicely charge your understanding soulWith opening titles miscreate, whose rightSuits not in native colours with the truth;For God doth know how many now in healthShall drop their blood in approbationOf what your reverence shall incite us to.Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,How you awake our sleeping sword of war:We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;For never two such kingdoms did contendWithout much fall of blood; whose guiltless dropsAre every one a woe, a sore complaint'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swordsThat make such waste in brief mortality.Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;For we will hear, note and believe in heartThat what you speak is in your conscience wash'dAs pure as sin with baptism.CANTERBURYThen hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,That owe yourselves, your lives and servicesTo this imperial throne. There is no barTo make against your highness' claim to FranceBut this, which they produce from Pharamond,'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:''No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'Which Salique land the French unjustly glozeTo be the realm of France, and PharamondThe founder of this law and female bar.Yet their own authors faithfully affirmThat the land Salique is in Germany,Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,There left behind and settled certain French;Who, holding in disdain the German womenFor some dishonest manners of their life,Establish'd then this law; to wit, no femaleShould be inheritrix in Salique land:Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.Then doth it well appear that Salique lawWas not devised for the realm of France:Nor did the French possess the Salique landUntil four hundred one and twenty yearsAfter defunction of King Pharamond,Idly supposed the founder of this law;Who died within the year of our redemptionFour hundred twenty-six; and Charles the GreatSubdued the Saxons, and did seat the FrenchBeyond the river Sala, in the yearEight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,Did, as heir general, being descendedOf Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,Make claim and title to the crown of France.Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crownOf Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir maleOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great,To find his title with some shows of truth,'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,Daughter to Charlemain, who was the sonTo Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the sonOf Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,Could not keep quiet in his conscience,Wearing the crown of France, till satisfiedThat fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:By the which marriage the line of Charles the GreatWas re-united to the crown of France.So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,King Lewis his satisfaction, all appearTo hold in right and title of the female:So do the kings of France unto this day;Howbeit they would hold up this Salique lawTo bar your highness claiming from the female,And rather choose to hide them in a netThan amply to imbar their crooked titlesUsurp'd from you and your progenitors.KING HENRY VMay I with right and conscience make this claim?CANTERBURYThe sin upon my head, dread sovereign!For in the book of Numbers is it writ,When the man dies, let the inheritanceDescend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;Look back into your mighty ancestors:Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,Making defeat on the full power of France,Whiles his most mighty father on a hillStood smiling to behold his lion's whelpForage in blood of French nobility.O noble English. that could entertainWith half their forces the full Pride of FranceAnd let another half stand laughing by,All out of work and cold for action!ELYAwake remembrance of these valiant deadAnd with your puissant arm renew their feats:You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;The blood and courage that renowned themRuns in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liegeIs in the very May-morn of his youth,Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.EXETERYour brother kings and monarchs of the earthDo all expect that you should rouse yourself,As did the former lions of your blood.WESTMORELANDThey know your grace hath cause and means and might;So hath your highness; never king of EnglandHad nobles richer and more loyal subjects,Whose hearts have left their bodies here in EnglandAnd lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.CANTERBURYO, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,With blood and sword and fire to win your right;In aid whereof we of the spiritualtyWill raise your highness such a mighty sumAs never did the clergy at one timeBring in to any of your ancestors.KING HENRY VWe must not only arm to invade the French,But lay down our proportions to defendAgainst the Scot, who will make road upon usWith all advantages.CANTERBURYThey of those marches, gracious sovereign,Shall be a wall sufficient to defendOur inland from the pilfering borderers.KING HENRY VWe do not mean the coursing snatchers only,But fear the main intendment of the Scot,Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;For you shall read that my great-grandfatherNever went with his forces into FranceBut that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdomCame pouring, like the tide into a breach,With ample and brim fulness of his force,Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;That England, being empty of defence,Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.CANTERBURYShe hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;For hear her but exampled by herself:When all her chivalry hath been in FranceAnd she a mourning widow of her nobles,She hath herself not only well defendedBut taken and impounded as a strayThe King of Scots; whom she did send to France,To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kingsAnd make her chronicle as rich with praiseAs is the ooze and bottom of the seaWith sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.WESTMORELANDBut there's a saying very old and true,'If that you will France win,Then with Scotland first begin:'For once the eagle England being in prey,To her unguarded nest the weasel ScotComes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,To tear and havoc more than she can eat.EXETERIt follows then the cat must stay at home:Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,The advised head defends itself at home;For government, though high and low and lower,Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,Congreeing in a full and natural close,Like music.CANTERBURYTherefore doth heaven divideThe state of man in divers functions,Setting endeavour in continual motion;To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,Creatures that by a rule in nature teachThe act of order to a peopled kingdom.They have a king and officers of sorts;Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,Which pillage they with merry march bring homeTo the tent-royal of their emperor;Who, busied in his majesty, surveysThe singing masons building roofs of gold,The civil citizens kneading up the honey,The poor mechanic porters crowding inTheir heavy burdens at his narrow gate,The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,Delivering o'er to executors paleThe lazy yawning drone. I this infer,That many things, having full referenceTo one consent, may work contrariously:As many arrows, loosed several ways,Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;As many lines close in the dial's centre;So may a thousand actions, once afoot.End in one purpose, and be all well borneWithout defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.Divide your happy England into four;Whereof take you one quarter into France,And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.If we, with thrice such powers left at home,Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,Let us be worried and our nation loseThe name of hardiness and policy.KING HENRY VCall in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.Exeunt some AttendantsNow are we well resolved; and, by God's help,And yours, the noble sinews of our power,France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,Ruling in large and ample emperyO'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,Tombless, with no remembrance over them:Either our history shall with full mouthSpeak freely of our acts, or else our grave,Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.Enter Ambassadors of FranceNow are we well prepared to know the pleasureOf our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hearYour greeting is from him, not from the king.First AmbassadorMay't please your majesty to give us leaveFreely to render what we have in charge;Or shall we sparingly show you far offThe Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?KING HENRY VWe are no tyrant, but a Christian king;Unto whose grace our passion is as subjectAs are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainnessTell us the Dauphin's mind.First AmbassadorThus, then, in few.Your highness, lately sending into France,Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the rightOf your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.In answer of which claim, the prince our masterSays that you savour too much of your youth,And bids you be advised there's nought in FranceThat can be with a nimble galliard won;You cannot revel into dukedoms there.He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,Desires you let the dukedoms that you claimHear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.KING HENRY VWhat treasure, uncle?EXETERTennis-balls, my liege.KING HENRY VWe are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;His present and your pains we thank you for:When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,We will, in France, by God's grace, play a setShall strike his father's crown into the hazard.Tell him he hath made a match with such a wranglerThat all the courts of France will be disturb'dWith chaces. And we understand him well,How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,Not measuring what use we made of them.We never valued this poor seat of England;And therefore, living hence, did give ourselfTo barbarous licence; as 'tis ever commonThat men are merriest when they are from home.But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,Be like a king and show my sail of greatnessWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France:For that I have laid by my majestyAnd plodded like a man for working-days,But I will rise there with so full a gloryThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.And tell the pleasant prince this mock of hisHath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soulShall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeanceThat shall fly with them: for many a thousand widowsShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;And some are yet ungotten and unbornThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.But this lies all within the will of God,To whom I do appeal; and in whose nameTell you the Dauphin I am coming on,To venge me as I may and to put forthMy rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.So get you hence in peace; and tell the DauphinHis jest will savour but of shallow wit,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.Exeunt AmbassadorsEXETERThis was a merry message.KING HENRY VWe hope to make the sender blush at it.Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hourThat may give furtherance to our expedition;For we have now no thought in us but France,Save those to God, that run before our business.Therefore let our proportions for these warsBe soon collected and all things thought uponThat may with reasonable swiftness addMore feathers to our wings; for, God before,We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.Therefore let every man now task his thought,That this fair action may on foot be brought.Exeunt. FlourishACT IIPROLOGUEEnter ChorusChorusNow all the youth of England are on fire,And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thoughtReigns solely in the breast of every man:They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,Following the mirror of all Christian kings,With winged heels, as English Mercuries.For now sits Expectation in the air,And hides a sword from hilts unto the pointWith crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,Promised to Harry and his followers.The French, advised by good intelligenceOf this most dreadful preparation,Shake in their fear and with pale policySeek to divert the English purposes.O England! model to thy inward greatness,Like little body with a mighty heart,What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,Were all thy children kind and natural!But see thy fault! France hath in thee found outA nest of hollow bosoms, which he fillsWith treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;And by their hands this grace of kings must die,If hell and treason hold their promises,Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.Linger your patience on; and we'll digestThe abuse of distance; force a play:The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;The king is set from London; and the sceneIs now transported, gentles, to Southampton;There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:And thence to France shall we convey you safe,And bring you back, charming the narrow seasTo give you gentle pass; for, if we may,We'll not offend one stomach with our play.But, till the king come forth, and not till then,Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.ExitSCENE I.

Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and AttendantsKING HENRY VNow sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:Think you not that the powers we bear with usWill cut their passage through the force of France,Doing the execution and the actFor which we have in head assembled them?SCROOPNo doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.KING HENRY VI doubt not that; since we are well persuadedWe carry not a heart with us from henceThat grows not in a fair consent with ours,Nor leave not one behind that doth not wishSuccess and conquest to attend on us.CAMBRIDGENever was monarch better fear'd and lovedThan is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subjectThat sits in heart-grief and uneasinessUnder the sweet shade of your government.GREYTrue: those that were your father's enemiesHave steep'd their galls in honey and do serve youWith hearts create of duty and of zeal.KING HENRY VWe therefore have great cause of thankfulness;And shall forget the office of our hand,Sooner than quittance of desert and meritAccording to the weight and worthiness.SCROOPSo service shall with steeled sinews toil,And labour shall refresh itself with hope,To do your grace incessant services.KING HENRY VWe judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,Enlarge the man committed yesterday,That rail'd against our person: we considerit was excess of wine that set him on;And on his more advice we pardon him.SCROOPThat's mercy, but too much security:Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest exampleBreed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.KING HENRY VO, let us yet be merciful.CAMBRIDGESo may your highness, and yet punish too.GREYSir,You show great mercy, if you give him life,After the taste of much correction.KING HENRY VAlas, your too much love and care of meAre heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!If little faults, proceeding on distemper,Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eyeWhen capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear careAnd tender preservation of our person,Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:Who are the late commissioners?CAMBRIDGEI one, my lord:Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.SCROOPSo did you me, my liege.GREYAnd I, my royal sovereign.KING HENRY VThen, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!What see you in those papers that you loseSo much complexion? Look ye, how they change!Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you thereThat hath so cowarded and chased your bloodOut of appearance?CAMBRIDGEI do confess my fault;And do submit me to your highness' mercy.GREYSCROOPTo which we all appeal.KING HENRY VThe mercy that was quick in us but late,By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.See you, my princes, and my noble peers,These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,You know how apt our love was to accordTo furnish him with all appertinentsBelonging to his honour; and this manHath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,And sworn unto the practises of France,To kill us here in Hampton: to the whichThis knight, no less for bounty bound to usThan Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,May it be possible, that foreign hireCould out of thee extract one spark of evilThat might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,That, though the truth of it stands off as grossAs black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.Treason and murder ever kept together,As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,Working so grossly in a natural cause,That admiration did not whoop at them:But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring inWonder to wait on treason and on murder:And whatsoever cunning fiend it wasThat wrought upon thee so preposterouslyHath got the voice in hell for excellence:All other devils that suggest by treasonsDo botch and bungle up damnationWith patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'dFrom glistering semblances of piety;But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thusShould with his lion gait walk the whole world,He might return to vasty Tartar back,And tell the legions 'I can never winA soul so easy as that Englishman's.'O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infectedThe sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,Not working with the eye without the ear,And but in purged judgment trusting neither?Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,To mark the full-fraught man and best induedWith some suspicion. I will weep for thee;For this revolt of thine, methinks, is likeAnother fall of man. Their faults are open:Arrest them to the answer of the law;And God acquit them of their practises!EXETERI arrest thee of high treason, by the name ofRichard Earl of Cambridge.I arrest thee of high treason, by the name ofHenry Lord Scroop of Masham.I arrest thee of high treason, by the name ofThomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.SCROOPOur purposes God justly hath discover'd;And I repent my fault more than my death;Which I beseech your highness to forgive,Although my body pay the price of it.CAMBRIDGEFor me, the gold of France did not seduce;Although I did admit it as a motiveThe sooner to effect what I intended:But God be thanked for prevention;Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,Beseeching God and you to pardon me.GREYNever did faithful subject more rejoiceAt the discovery of most dangerous treasonThan I do at this hour joy o'er myself.Prevented from a damned enterprise:My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.KING HENRY VGod quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.You have conspired against our royal person,Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffersReceived the golden earnest of our death;Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,His princes and his peers to servitude,His subjects to oppression and contemptAnd his whole kingdom into desolation.Touching our person seek we no revenge;But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,Whose ruin you have sought, that to her lawsWe do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,Poor miserable wretches, to your death:The taste whereof, God of his mercy giveYou patience to endure, and true repentanceOf all your dear offences! Bear them hence.Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guardedNow, lords, for France; the enterprise whereofShall be to you, as us, like glorious.We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,Since God so graciously hath brought to lightThis dangerous treason lurking in our wayTo hinder our beginnings. We doubt not nowBut every rub is smoothed on our way.Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliverOur puissance into the hand of God,Putting it straight in expedition.Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:No king of England, if not king of France.ExeuntSCENE III.

A' madea finer end and went away an it had been anychristom child; a' parted even just between twelveand one, even at the turning o' the tide: for afterI saw him fumble with the sheets and play withflowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knewthere was but one way; for his nose was as sharp asa pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' goodcheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three orfour times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'should not think of God; I hoped there was no needto trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. Soa' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put myhand into the bed and felt them, and they were ascold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, andthey were as cold as any stone, and so upward andupward, and all was as cold as any stone.NYMThey say he cried out of sack.HostessAy, that a' did.BARDOLPHAnd of women.HostessNay, that a' did not.BoyYes, that a' did; and said they were devilsincarnate.HostessA' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour henever liked.BoyA' said once, the devil would have him about women.HostessA' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but thenhe was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.BoyDo you not remember, a' saw a flea stick uponBardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soulburning in hell-fire?BARDOLPHWell, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:that's all the riches I got in his service.NYMShall we shog? the king will be gone fromSouthampton.PISTOLCome, let's away.

Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and othersKING OF FRANCEThus comes the English with full power upon us;And more than carefully it us concernsTo answer royally in our defences.Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,To line and new repair our towns of warWith men of courage and with means defendant;For England his approaches makes as fierceAs waters to the sucking of a gulf.It fits us then to be as providentAs fear may teach us out of late examplesLeft by the fatal and neglected EnglishUpon our fields.DAUPHINMy most redoubted father,It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,But that defences, musters, preparations,Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,As were a war in expectation.Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forthTo view the sick and feeble parts of France:And let us do it with no show of fear;No, with no more than if we heard that EnglandWere busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,Her sceptre so fantastically borneBy a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,That fear attends her not.ConstableO peace, Prince Dauphin!You are too much mistaken in this king:Question your grace the late ambassadors,With what great state he heard their embassy,How well supplied with noble counsellors,How modest in exception, and withalHow terrible in constant resolution,And you shall find his vanities forespentWere but the outside of the Roman Brutus,Covering discretion with a coat of folly;As gardeners do with ordure hide those rootsThat shall first spring and be most delicate.DAUPHINWell, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;But though we think it so, it is no matter:In cases of defence 'tis best to weighThe enemy more mighty than he seems:So the proportions of defence are fill'd;Which of a weak or niggardly projectionDoth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scantingA little cloth.KING OF FRANCEThink we King Harry strong;And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;And he is bred out of that bloody strainThat haunted us in our familiar paths:Witness our too much memorable shameWhen Cressy battle fatally was struck,And all our princes captiv'd by the handOf that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,Mangle the work of nature and defaceThe patterns that by God and by French fathersHad twenty years been made. This is a stemOf that victorious stock; and let us fearThe native mightiness and fate of him.Enter a MessengerMessengerAmbassadors from Harry King of EnglandDo crave admittance to your majesty.KING OF FRANCEWe'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.Exeunt Messenger and certain LordsYou see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.DAUPHINTurn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogsMost spend their mouths when what they seem to threatenRuns far before them. Good my sovereign,Take up the English short, and let them knowOf what a monarchy you are the head:Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sinAs self-neglecting.Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and trainKING OF FRANCEFrom our brother England?EXETERFrom him; and thus he greets your majesty.He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,That you divest yourself, and lay apartThe borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,By law of nature and of nations, 'longTo him and to his heirs; namely, the crownAnd all wide-stretched honours that pertainBy custom and the ordinance of timesUnto the crown of France. That you may know'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,He sends you this most memorable line,In every branch truly demonstrative;Willing to overlook this pedigree:And when you find him evenly derivedFrom his most famed of famous ancestors,Edward the Third, he bids you then resignYour crown and kingdom, indirectly heldFrom him the native and true challenger.KING OF FRANCEOr else what follows?EXETERBloody constraint; for if you hide the crownEven in your hearts, there will he rake for it:Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,That, if requiring fail, he will compel;And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,Deliver up the crown, and to take mercyOn the poor souls for whom this hungry warOpens his vasty jaws; and on your headTurning the widows' tears, the orphans' criesThe dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.This is his claim, his threatening and my message;Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,To whom expressly I bring greeting too.KING OF FRANCEFor us, we will consider of this further:To-morrow shall you bear our full intentBack to our brother England.DAUPHINFor the Dauphin,I stand here for him: what to him from England?EXETERScorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,And any thing that may not misbecomeThe mighty sender, doth he prize you at.Thus says my king; an' if your father's highnessDo not, in grant of all demands at large,Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,That caves and womby vaultages of FranceShall chide your trespass and return your mockIn second accent of his ordnance.DAUPHINSay, if my father render fair return,It is against my will; for I desireNothing but odds with England: to that end,As matching to his youth and vanity,I did present him with the Paris balls.EXETERHe'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:And, be assured, you'll find a difference,As we his subjects have in wonder found,Between the promise of his greener daysAnd these he masters now: now he weighs timeEven to the utmost grain: that you shall readIn your own losses, if he stay in France.KING OF FRANCETo-morrow shall you know our mind at full.EXETERDispatch us with all speed, lest that our kingCome here himself to question our delay;For he is footed in this land already.KING OF FRANCEYou shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:A night is but small breath and little pauseTo answer matters of this consequence.Flourish. ExeuntACT IIIPROLOGUEEnter ChorusChorusThus with imagined wing our swift scene fliesIn motion of no less celerityThan that of thought. Suppose that you have seenThe well-appointed king at Hampton pierEmbark his royalty; and his brave fleetWith silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:Play with your fancies, and in them beholdUpon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;Hear the shrill whistle which doth order giveTo sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but thinkYou stand upon the ravage and beholdA city on the inconstant billows dancing;For so appears this fleet majestical,Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,And leave your England, as dead midnight still,Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'dWith one appearing hair, that will not followThese cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;Behold the ordnance on their carriages,With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;Tells Harry that the king doth offer himKatharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.The offer likes not: and the nimble gunnerWith linstock now the devilish cannon touches,Alarum, and chambers go offAnd down goes all before them. Still be kind,And eke out our performance with your mind.ExitSCENE I. France. Before Harfleur.Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers, with scaling-laddersKING HENRY VOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;Or close the wall up with our English dead.In peace there's nothing so becomes a manAs modest stillness and humility:But when the blast of war blows in our ears,Then imitate the action of the tiger;Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;Let pry through the portage of the headLike the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm itAs fearfully as doth a galled rockO'erhang and jutty his confounded base,Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,Hold hard the breath and bend up every spiritTo his full height. On, on, you noblest English.Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,Have in these parts from morn till even foughtAnd sheathed their swords for lack of argument:Dishonour not your mothers; now attestThat those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.Be copy now to men of grosser blood,And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,Whose limbs were made in England, show us hereThe mettle of your pasture; let us swearThat you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;For there is none of you so mean and base,That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,Straining upon the start.

I am boy to them all three: but all theythree, though they would serve me, could not be manto me; for indeed three such antics do not amount toa man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered andred-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, butfights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongueand a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breakswords, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hathheard that men of few words are the best men; andtherefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'should be thought a coward: but his few bad wordsare matched with as few good deeds; for a' neverbroke any man's head but his own, and that wasagainst a post when he was drunk. They will stealany thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole alute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it forthree half pence. Nym and Bardolph are swornbrothers in filching, and in Calais they stole afire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service themen would carry coals. They would have me asfamiliar with men's pockets as their gloves or theirhandkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,if I should take from another's pocket to put intomine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. Imust leave them, and seek some better service:their villany goes against my weak stomach, andtherefore I must cast it up.ExitRe-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER followingGOWERCaptain Fluellen, you must come presently to themines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.FLUELLENTo the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so goodto come to the mines; for, look you, the mines isnot according to the disciplines of the war: theconcavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, lookyou, is digt himself four yard under thecountermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough upall, if there is not better directions.GOWERThe Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of thesiege is given, is altogether directed by anIrishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.FLUELLENIt is Captain Macmorris, is it not?GOWERI think it be.FLUELLENBy Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I willverify as much in his beard: be has no moredirections in the true disciplines of the wars, lookyou, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMYGOWERHere a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.FLUELLENCaptain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,that is certain; and of great expedition andknowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particularknowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he willmaintain his argument as well as any military man inthe world, in the disciplines of the pristine warsof the Romans.JAMYI say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.FLUELLENGod-den to your worship, good Captain James.GOWERHow now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit themines? have the pioneers given o'er?MACMORRISBy Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish giveover, the trompet sound the retreat.

Enter KING HENRY and his trainKING HENRY VHow yet resolves the governor of the town?This is the latest parle we will admit;Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;Or like to men proud of destructionDefy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,If I begin the battery once again,I will not leave the half-achieved HarfleurTill in her ashes she lie buried.The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,In liberty of bloody hand shall rangeWith conscience wide as hell, mowing like grassYour fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.What is it then to me, if impious war,Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell featsEnlink'd to waste and desolation?What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,If your pure maidens fall into the handOf hot and forcing violation?What rein can hold licentious wickednessWhen down the hill he holds his fierce career?We may as bootless spend our vain commandUpon the enraged soldiers in their spoilAs send precepts to the leviathanTo come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,Take pity of your town and of your people,Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of graceO'erblows the filthy and contagious cloudsOf heady murder, spoil and villany.If not, why, in a moment look to seeThe blind and bloody soldier with foul handDefile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;Your fathers taken by the silver beards,And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confusedDo break the clouds, as did the wives of JewryAt Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?GOVERNOROur expectation hath this day an end:The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,Returns us that his powers are yet not readyTo raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;For we no longer are defensible.KING HENRY VOpen your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:Use mercy to them all.

Fortune ispainted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, tosignify to you that Fortune is blind; and she ispainted also with a wheel, to signify to you, whichis the moral of it, that she is turning, andinconstant, and mutability, and variation: and herfoot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,the poet makes a most excellent description of it:Fortune is an excellent moral.PISTOLFortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:A damned death!Let gallows gape for dog; let man go freeAnd let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:But Exeter hath given the doom of deathFor pax of little price.Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cutWith edge of penny cord and vile reproach:Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.FLUELLENAunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.PISTOLWhy then, rejoice therefore.FLUELLENCertainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoiceat: for if, look you, he were my brother, I woulddesire the duke to use his good pleasure, and puthim to execution; for discipline ought to be used.PISTOLDie and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!FLUELLENIt is well.PISTOLThe fig of Spain!ExitFLUELLENVery good.GOWERWhy, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; Iremember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.FLUELLENI'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at thebridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But itis very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,I warrant you, when time is serve.GOWERWhy, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and thengoes to the wars, to grace himself at his returninto London under the form of a soldier. And suchfellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:and they will learn you by rote where services weredone; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who wasshot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and whata beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit ofthe camp will do among foaming bottles andale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. Butyou must learn to know such slanders of the age, orelse you may be marvellously mistook.FLUELLENI tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he isnot the man that he would gladly make show to theworld he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I willtell him my mind.Drum heardHark you, the king is coming, and I must speak withhim from the pridge.Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and SoldiersGod pless your majesty!KING HENRY VHow now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?FLUELLENAy, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter hasvery gallantly maintained the pridge: the French isgone off, look you; and there is gallant and mostprave passages; marry, th' athversary was havepossession of the pridge; but he is enforced toretire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of thepridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is aprave man.KING HENRY VWhat men have you lost, Fluellen?FLUELLENThe perdition of th' athversary hath been verygreat, reasonable great: marry, for my part, Ithink the duke hath lost never a man, but one thatis like to be executed for robbing a church, oneBardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face isall bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is likea coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;but his nose is executed and his fire's out.KING HENRY VWe would have all such offenders so cut off: and wegive express charge, that in our marches through thecountry, there be nothing compelled from thevillages, nothing taken but paid for, none of theFrench upbraided or abused in disdainful language;for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, thegentler gamester is the soonest winner.Tucket. Enter MONTJOYMONTJOYYou know me by my habit.KING HENRY VWell then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?MONTJOYMy master's mind.KING HENRY VUnfold it.MONTJOYThus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantageis a better soldier than rashness. Tell him wecould have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that wethought not good to bruise an injury till it werefull ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voiceis imperial: England shall repent his folly, seehis weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid himtherefore consider of his ransom; which mustproportion the losses we have borne, the subjects wehave lost, the disgrace we have digested; which inweight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for theeffusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom toofaint a number; and for our disgrace, his ownperson, kneeling at our feet, but a weak andworthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: andtell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed hisfollowers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So farmy king and master; so much my office.KING HENRY VWhat is thy name? I know thy quality.MONTJOYMontjoy.KING HENRY VThou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.And tell thy king I do not seek him now;But could be willing to march on to CalaisWithout impeachment: for, to say the sooth,Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so muchUnto an enemy of craft and vantage,My people are with sickness much enfeebled,My numbers lessened, and those few I haveAlmost no better than so many French;Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,I thought upon one pair of English legsDid march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,That I do brag thus! This your air of FranceHath blown that vice in me: I must repent.Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,My army but a weak and sickly guard;Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,Though France himself and such another neighbourStand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.Go bid thy master well advise himself:If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,We shall your tawny ground with your red bloodDiscolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.The sum of all our answer is but this:We would not seek a battle, as we are;Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:So tell your master.MONTJOYI shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.ExitGLOUCESTERI hope they will not come upon us now.KING HENRY VWe are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,And on to-morrow, bid them march away.ExeuntSCENE VII. The French camp, near Agincourt:Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES, ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with othersConstableTut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!ORLEANSYou have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.ConstableIt is the best horse of Europe.ORLEANSWill it never be morning?DAUPHINMy lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, youtalk of horse and armour?ORLEANSYou are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.DAUPHINWhat a long night is this! I will not change myhorse with any that treads but on four pasterns.Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if hisentrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, Isoar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earthsings when he touches it; the basest horn of hishoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.ORLEANSHe's of the colour of the nutmeg.DAUPHINAnd of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast forPerseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dullelements of earth and water never appear in him, butonly in Patient stillness while his rider mountshim: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades youmay call beasts.ConstableIndeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.DAUPHINIt is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like thebidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.ORLEANSNo more, cousin.DAUPHINNay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from therising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, varydeserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme asfluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquenttongues, and my horse is argument for them all:'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and fora sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for theworld, familiar to us and unknown to lay aparttheir particular functions and wonder at him. Ionce writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:'Wonder of nature,'--ORLEANSI have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.DAUPHINThen did they imitate that which I composed to mycourser, for my horse is my mistress.ORLEANSYour mistress bears well.DAUPHINMe well; which is the prescript praise andperfection of a good and particular mistress.ConstableNay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdlyshook your back.DAUPHINSo perhaps did yours.ConstableMine was not bridled.DAUPHINO then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and inyour straight strossers.ConstableYou have good judgment in horsemanship.DAUPHINBe warned by me, then: they that ride so and ridenot warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather havemy horse to my mistress.ConstableI had as lief have my mistress a jade.DAUPHINI tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.ConstableI could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sowto my mistress.DAUPHIN'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, etla truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.ConstableYet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or anysuch proverb so little kin to the purpose.RAMBURESMy lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tentto-night, are those stars or suns upon it?ConstableStars, my lord.DAUPHINSome of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.ConstableAnd yet my sky shall not want.DAUPHINThat may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and'twere more honour some were away.ConstableEven as your horse bears your praises; who wouldtrot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.DAUPHINWould I were able to load him with his desert! Willit never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, andmy way shall be paved with English faces.ConstableI will not say so, for fear I should be faced out ofmy way: but I would it were morning; for I wouldfain be about the ears of the English.RAMBURESWho will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?ConstableYou must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.DAUPHIN'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.ExitORLEANSThe Dauphin longs for morning.RAMBURESHe longs to eat the English.ConstableI think he will eat all he kills.ORLEANSBy the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.ConstableSwear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.ORLEANSHe is simply the most active gentleman of France.ConstableDoing is activity; and he will still be doing.ORLEANSHe never did harm, that I heard of.ConstableNor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.ORLEANSI know him to be valiant.ConstableI was told that  by one that knows him better thanyou.ORLEANSWhat's he?ConstableMarry, he told me so himself; and he said he carednot who knew itORLEANSHe needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.ConstableBy my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw itbut his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when itappears, it will bate.ORLEANSIll will never said well.ConstableI will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'ORLEANSAnd I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'ConstableWell placed: there stands your friend for thedevil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'Apox of the devil.'ORLEANSYou are the better at proverbs, by how much 'Afool's bolt is soon shot.'ConstableYou have shot over.ORLEANS'Tis not the first time you were overshot.Enter a MessengerMessengerMy lord high constable, the English lie withinfifteen hundred paces of your tents.ConstableWho hath measured the ground?MessengerThe Lord Grandpre.ConstableA valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it wereday! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not forthe dawning as we do.ORLEANSWhat a wretched and peevish fellow is this king ofEngland, to mope with his fat-brained followers sofar out of his knowledge!ConstableIf the English had any apprehension, they would run away.ORLEANSThat they lack; for if their heads had anyintellectual armour, they could never wear such heavyhead-pieces.RAMBURESThat island of England breeds very valiantcreatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.ORLEANSFoolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of aRussian bear and have their heads crushed likerotten apples! You may as well say, that's avaliant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.ConstableJust, just; and the men do sympathize with themastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leavingtheir wits with their wives: and then give themgreat meals of beef and iron and steel, they willeat like wolves and fight like devils.ORLEANSAy, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.ConstableThen shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachsto eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:come, shall we about it?ORLEANSIt is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by tenWe shall have each a hundred Englishmen.ExeuntACT IVPROLOGUEEnter ChorusChorusNow entertain conjecture of a timeWhen creeping murmur and the poring darkFills the wide vessel of the universe.From camp to camp through the foul womb of nightThe hum of either army stilly sounds,That the fixed sentinels almost receiveThe secret whispers of each other's watch:Fire answers fire, and through their paly flamesEach battle sees the other's umber'd face;Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighsPiercing the night's dull ear, and from the tentsThe armourers, accomplishing the knights,With busy hammers closing rivets up,Give dreadful note of preparation:The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,And the third hour of drowsy morning name.Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,The confident and over-lusty FrenchDo the low-rated English play at dice;And chide the cripple tardy-gaited nightWho, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limpSo tediously away. The poor condemned English,Like sacrifices, by their watchful firesSit patiently and inly ruminateThe morning's danger, and their gesture sadInvesting lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coatsPresenteth them unto the gazing moonSo many horrid ghosts. O now, who will beholdThe royal captain of this ruin'd bandWalking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'For forth he goes and visits all his host.Bids them good morrow with a modest smileAnd calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.Upon his royal face there is no noteHow dread an army hath enrounded him;Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colourUnto the weary and all-watched night,But freshly looks and over-bears attaintWith cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;That every wretch, pining and pale before,Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:A largess universal like the sunHis liberal eye doth give to every one,Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,Behold, as may unworthiness define,A little touch of Harry in the night.And so our scene must to the battle fly;Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgraceWith four or five most vile and ragged foils,Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,Minding true things by what their mockeries be.ExitSCENE I. The English camp at Agincourt.Enter KING HENRY, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTERKING HENRY VGloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;The greater therefore should our courage be.Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!There is some soul of goodness in things evil,Would men observingly distil it out.For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,Which is both healthful and good husbandry:Besides, they are our outward consciences,And preachers to us all, admonishingThat we should dress us fairly for our end.Thus may we gather honey from the weed,And make a moral of the devil himself.Enter ERPINGHAMGood morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:A good soft pillow for that good white headWere better than a churlish turf of France.ERPINGHAMNot so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'KING HENRY V'Tis good for men to love their present painsUpon example; so the spirit is eased:And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,The organs, though defunct and dead before,Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,With casted slough and fresh legerity.Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,Commend me to the princes in our camp;Do my good morrow to them, and anonDesire them an to my pavilion.GLOUCESTERWe shall, my liege.ERPINGHAMShall I attend your grace?KING HENRY VNo, my good knight;Go with my brothers to my lords of England:I and my bosom must debate awhile,And then I would no other company.ERPINGHAMThe Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!Exeunt all but KING HENRYKING HENRY VGod-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.Enter PISTOLPISTOLQui va la?KING HENRY VA friend.PISTOLDiscuss unto me; art thou officer?Or art thou base, common and popular?KING HENRY VI am a gentleman of a company.PISTOLTrail'st thou the puissant pike?KING HENRY VEven so. What are you?PISTOLAs good a gentleman as the emperor.KING HENRY VThen you are a better than the king.PISTOLThe king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,A lad of life, an imp of fame;Of parents good, of fist most valiant.I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-stringI love the lovely bully. What is thy name?KING HENRY VHarry le Roy.PISTOLLe Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?KING HENRY VNo, I am a Welshman.PISTOLKnow'st thou Fluellen?KING HENRY VYes.PISTOLTell him, I'll knock his leek about his pateUpon Saint Davy's day.KING HENRY VDo not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,lest he knock that about yours.PISTOLArt thou his friend?KING HENRY VAnd his kinsman too.PISTOLThe figo for thee, then!KING HENRY VI thank you: God be with you!PISTOLMy name is Pistol call'd.ExitKING HENRY VIt sorts well with your fierceness.Enter FLUELLEN and GOWERGOWERCaptain Fluellen!FLUELLENSo! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It isthe greatest admiration of the universal world, whenthe true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of thewars is not kept: if you would take the pains but toexamine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shallfind, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddlenor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and thecares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobrietyof it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.GOWERWhy, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.FLUELLENIf the enemy is an ass and a fool and a pratingcoxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,look you, be an ass and a fool and a pratingcoxcomb? in your own conscience, now?GOWERI will speak lower.FLUELLENI pray you and beseech you that you will.Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLENKING HENRY VThough it appear a little out of fashion,There is much care and valour in this Welshman.Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and MICHAEL WILLIAMSCOURTBrother John Bates, is not that the morning whichbreaks yonder?BATESI think it be: but we have no great cause to desirethe approach of day.WILLIAMSWe see yonder the beginning of the day, but I thinkwe shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?KING HENRY VA friend.WILLIAMSUnder what captain serve you?KING HENRY VUnder Sir Thomas Erpingham.WILLIAMSA good old commander and a most kind gentleman: Ipray you, what thinks he of our estate?KING HENRY VEven as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to bewashed off the next tide.BATESHe hath not told his thought to the king?KING HENRY VNo; nor it is not meet he should. For, though Ispeak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as Iam: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: theelement shows to him as it doth to me; all hissenses have but human conditions: his ceremonieslaid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; andthough his affections are higher mounted than ours,yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the likewing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as wedo, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relishas ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possesshim with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showingit, should dishearten his army.BATESHe may show what outward courage he will; but Ibelieve, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wishhimself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would hewere, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.KING HENRY VBy my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:I think he would not wish himself any where butwhere he is.BATESThen I would he were here alone; so should he besure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.KING HENRY VI dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him herealone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men'sminds: methinks I could not die any where socontented as in the king's company; his cause beingjust and his quarrel honourable.WILLIAMSThat's more than we know.BATESAy, or more than we should seek after; for we knowenough, if we know we are the kings subjects: ifhis cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipesthe crime of it out of us.WILLIAMSBut if the cause be not good, the king himself hatha heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs andarms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall jointogether at the latter day and cry all 'We died atsuch a place;' some swearing, some crying for asurgeon, some upon their wives left poor behindthem, some upon the debts they owe, some upon theirchildren rawly left. I am afeard there are few diewell that die in a battle; for how can theycharitably dispose of any thing, when blood is theirargument? Now, if these men do not die well, itwill be a black matter for the king that led them toit; whom to disobey were against all proportion ofsubjection.KING HENRY VSo, if a son that is by his father sent aboutmerchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, theimputation of his wickedness by your rule, should beimposed upon his father that sent him: or if aservant, under his master's command transporting asum of money, be assailed by robbers and die inmany irreconciled iniquities, you may call thebusiness of the master the author of the servant'sdamnation: but this is not so: the king is notbound to answer the particular endings of hissoldiers, the father of his son, nor the master ofhis servant; for they purpose not their death, whenthey purpose their services. Besides, there is noking, be his cause never so spotless, if it come tothe arbitrement of swords, can try it out with allunspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on themthe guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals ofperjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, thathave before gored the gentle bosom of peace withpillage and robbery. Now, if these men havedefeated the law and outrun native punishment,though they can outstrip men, they have no wings tofly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;so that here men are punished for before-breach ofthe king's laws in now the king's quarrel: wherethey feared the death, they have borne life away;and where they would be safe, they perish: then ifthey die unprovided, no more is the king guilty oftheir damnation than he was before guilty of thoseimpieties for the which they are now visited. Everysubject's duty is the king's; but every subject'ssoul is his own. Therefore should every soldier inthe wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash everymote out of his conscience: and dying so, deathis to him advantage; or not dying, the time wasblessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:and in him that escapes, it were not sin to thinkthat, making God so free an offer, He let himoutlive that day to see His greatness and to teachothers how they should prepare.WILLIAMS'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill uponhis own head, the king is not to answer it.BATESBut I do not desire he should answer for me; andyet I determine to fight lustily for him.KING HENRY VI myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.WILLIAMSAy, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: butwhen our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and wene'er the wiser.KING HENRY VIf I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.WILLIAMSYou pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of anelder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure cando against a monarch! you may as well go about toturn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with apeacock's feather. You'll never trust his wordafter! come, 'tis a foolish saying.KING HENRY VYour reproof is something too round: I should beangry with you, if the time were convenient.WILLIAMSLet it be a quarrel between us, if you live.KING HENRY VI embrace it.WILLIAMSHow shall I know thee again?KING HENRY VGive me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in mybonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, Iwill make it my quarrel.WILLIAMSHere's my glove: give me another of thine.KING HENRY VThere.WILLIAMSThis will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou cometo me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.KING HENRY VIf ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.WILLIAMSThou darest as well be hanged.KING HENRY VWell. I will do it, though I take thee in theking's company.WILLIAMSKeep thy word: fare thee well.BATESBe friends, you English fools, be friends: we haveFrench quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.KING HENRY VIndeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns toone, they will beat us; for they bear them on theirshoulders: but it is no English treason to cutFrench crowns, and to-morrow the king himself willbe a clipper.Exeunt soldiersUpon the king! let us our lives, our souls,Our debts, our careful wives,Our children and our sins lay on the king!We must bear all. O hard condition,Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breathOf every fool, whose sense no more can feelBut his own wringing! What infinite heart's-easeMust kings neglect, that private men enjoy!And what have kings, that privates have not too,Save ceremony, save general ceremony?And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st moreOf mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?O ceremony, show me but thy worth!What is thy soul of adoration?Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,Creating awe and fear in other men?Wherein thou art less happy being fear'dThan they in fearing.What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!Think'st thou the fiery fever will go outWith titles blown from adulation?Will it give place to flexure and low bending?Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;I am a king that find thee, and I know'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,The farced title running 'fore the king,The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pompThat beats upon the high shore of this world,No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,Not all these, laid in bed majestical,Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,Who with a body fill'd and vacant mindGets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,But, like a lackey, from the rise to setSweats in the eye of Phoebus and all nightSleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,And follows so the ever-running year,With profitable labour, to his grave:And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.The slave, a member of the country's peace,Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wotsWhat watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,Whose hours the peasant best advantages.Enter ERPINGHAMERPINGHAMMy lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,Seek through your camp to find you.KING HENRY VGood old knight,Collect them all together at my tent:I'll be before thee.ERPINGHAMI shall do't, my lord.ExitKING HENRY VO God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;Possess them not with fear; take from them nowThe sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbersPluck their hearts from them.

I pray thee, wish not one man more.By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;It yearns me not if men my garments wear;Such outward things dwell not in my desires:But if it be a sin to covet honour,I am the most offending soul alive.No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:God's peace! I would not lose so great an honourAs one man more, methinks, would share from meFor the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,That he which hath no stomach to this fight,Let him depart; his passport shall be madeAnd crowns for convoy put into his purse:We would not die in that man's companyThat fears his fellowship to die with us.This day is called the feast of Crispian:He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,And rouse him at the name of Crispian.He that shall live this day, and see old age,Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,But he'll remember with advantagesWhat feats he did that day: then shall our names.Familiar in his mouth as household wordsHarry the king, Bedford and Exeter,Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.This story shall the good man teach his son;And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,From this day to the ending of the world,But we in it shall be remember'd;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;For he to-day that sheds his blood with meShall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,This day shall gentle his condition:And gentlemen in England now a-bedShall think themselves accursed they were not here,And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaksThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.Re-enter SALISBURYSALISBURYMy sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:The French are bravely in their battles set,And will with all expedience charge on us.KING HENRY VAll things are ready, if our minds be so.WESTMORELANDPerish the man whose mind is backward now!KING HENRY VThou dost not wish more help from England, coz?WESTMORELANDGod's will! my liege, would you and I alone,Without more help, could fight this royal battle!KING HENRY VWhy, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;Which likes me better than to wish us one.You know your places: God be with you all!Tucket.

If they do this,--As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom thenWill soon be levied.

Behold, the English beachPales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the kingSeems to prepare his way: so let him land,And solemnly see him set on to London.So swift a pace hath thought that even nowYou may imagine him upon Blackheath;Where that his lords desire him to have borneHis bruised helmet and his bended swordBefore him through the city: he forbids it,Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;Giving full trophy, signal and ostentQuite from himself to God. But now behold,In the quick forge and working-house of thought,How London doth pour out her citizens!The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,Like to the senators of the antique Rome,With the plebeians swarming at their heels,Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:As, by a lower but loving likelihood,Were now the general of our gracious empress,As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,How many would the peaceful city quit,To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;As yet the lamentation of the FrenchInvites the King of England's stay at home;The emperor's coming in behalf of France,To order peace between them; and omitAll the occurrences, whatever chanced,Till Harry's back-return again to France:There must we bring him; and myself have play'dThe interim, by remembering you 'tis past.Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,After your thoughts, straight back again to France.ExitSCENE I.

I have seen you gleeking andgalling at this gentleman twice or thrice. Youthought, because he could not speak English in thenative garb, he could not therefore handle anEnglish cudgel: you find it otherwise; andhenceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a goodEnglish condition. Fare ye well.ExitPISTOLDoth Fortune play the huswife with me now?News have I, that my Nell is dead i' the spitalOf malady of France;And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.Old I do wax; and from my weary limbsHonour is cudgelled.

France. A royal palace.Enter, at one door KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD,  GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and other Lords;  at another, the FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, the  PRINCESS KATHARINE, ALICE and other Ladies; the DUKE of BURGUNDY, and his trainKING HENRY VPeace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!Unto our brother France, and to our sister,Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishesTo our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;And, as a branch and member of this royalty,By whom this great assembly is contrived,We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!KING OF FRANCERight joyous are we to behold your face,Most worthy brother England; fairly met:So are you, princes English, every one.QUEEN ISABELSo happy be the issue, brother England,Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,As we are now glad to behold your eyes;Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in themAgainst the French, that met them in their bent,The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,Have lost their quality, and that this dayShall change all griefs and quarrels into love.KING HENRY VTo cry amen to that, thus we appear.QUEEN ISABELYou English princes all, I do salute you.BURGUNDYMy duty to you both, on equal love,Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,To bring your most imperial majestiesUnto this bar and royal interview,Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.Since then my office hath so far prevail'dThat, face to face and royal eye to eye,You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,If I demand, before this royal view,What rub or what impediment there is,Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,Should not in this best garden of the worldOur fertile France, put up her lovely visage?Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,Corrupting in its own fertility.Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leasThe darnel, hemlock and rank fumitoryDoth root upon, while that the coulter rustsThat should deracinate such savagery;The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forthThe freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,Conceives by idleness and nothing teemsBut hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,Losing both beauty and utility.And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,Even so our houses and ourselves and childrenHave lost, or do not learn for want of time,The sciences that should become our country;But grow like savages,--as soldiers willThat nothing do but meditate on blood,--To swearing and stern looks, diffused attireAnd every thing that seems unnatural.Which to reduce into our former favourYou are assembled: and my speech entreatsThat I may know the let, why gentle PeaceShould not expel these inconveniencesAnd bless us with her former qualities.KING HENRY VIf, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,Whose want gives growth to the imperfectionsWhich you have cited, you must buy that peaceWith full accord to all our just demands;Whose tenors and particular effectsYou have enscheduled briefly in your hands.BURGUNDYThe king hath heard them; to the which as yetThere is no answer made.KING HENRY VWell then the peace,Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.KING OF FRANCEI have but with a cursorary eyeO'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your graceTo appoint some of your council presentlyTo sit with us once more, with better heedTo re-survey them, we will suddenlyPass our accept and peremptory answer.KING HENRY VBrother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;And take with you free power to ratify,Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms bestShall see advantageable for our dignity,Any thing in or out of our demands,And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,Go with the princes, or stay here with us?QUEEN ISABELOur gracious brother, I will go with them:Haply a woman's voice may do some good,When articles too nicely urged be stood on.KING HENRY VYet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:She is our capital demand, comprisedWithin the fore-rank of our articles.QUEEN ISABELShe hath good leave.Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICEKING HENRY VFair Katharine, and most fair,Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier termsSuch as will enter at a lady's earAnd plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?KATHARINEYour majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.KING HENRY VO fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly withyour French heart, I will be glad to hear youconfess it brokenly with your English tongue. Doyou like me, Kate?KATHARINEPardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'KING HENRY VAn angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.KATHARINEQue dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?ALICEOui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.KING HENRY VI said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush toaffirm it.KATHARINEO bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines detromperies.KING HENRY VWhat says she, fair one? that the tongues of menare full of deceits?ALICEOui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full ofdeceits: dat is de princess.KING HENRY VThe princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I amglad thou canst speak no better English; for, ifthou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain kingthat thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy mycrown. I know no ways to mince it in love, butdirectly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge mefarther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear outmy suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and soclap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?KATHARINESauf votre honneur, me understand vell.KING HENRY VMarry, if you would put me to verses or to dance foryour sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, Ihave neither words nor measure, and for the other, Ihave no strength in measure, yet a reasonablemeasure in strength. If I could win a lady atleap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with myarmour on my back, under the correction of braggingbe it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horsefor her favours, I could lay on like a butcher andsit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out myeloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,nor never break for urging. If thou canst love afellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worthsun-burning, that never looks in his glass for loveof any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thycook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canstlove me for this, take me: if not, to say to theethat I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by theLord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thoulivest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain anduncoined constancy; for he perforce must do theeright, because he hath not the gift to woo in otherplaces: for these fellows of infinite tongue, thatcan rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they doalways reason themselves out again. What! aspeaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. Agood leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; ablack beard will turn white; a curled pate will growbald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will waxhollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and themoon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for itshines bright and never changes, but keeps hiscourse truly. If thou would have such a one, takeme; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.KATHARINEIs it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?KING HENRY VNo; it is not possible you should love the enemy ofFrance, Kate: but, in loving me, you should lovethe friend of France; for I love France so well thatI will not part with a village of it; I will have itall mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I amyours, then yours is France and you are mine.KATHARINEI cannot tell vat is dat.KING HENRY VNo, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I amsure will hang upon my tongue like a new-marriedwife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shookoff. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quandvous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, whatthen? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre estFrance et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so muchmore French: I shall never move thee in French,unless it be to laugh at me.KATHARINESauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, ilest meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.KING HENRY VNo, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of mytongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needsbe granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thouunderstand thus much English, canst thou love me?KATHARINEI cannot tell.KING HENRY VCan any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll askthem. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,when you come into your closet, you'll question thisgentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will toher dispraise those parts in me that you love withyour heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; therather, gentle princess, because I love theecruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have asaving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I getthee with scambling, and thou must therefore needsprove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound aboy, half French, half English, that shall go toConstantinople and take the Turk by the beard?shall we not? what sayest thou, my fairflower-de-luce?KATHARINEI do not know datKING HENRY VNo; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: dobut now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for yourFrench part of such a boy; and for my English moietytake the word of a king and a bachelor. How answeryou, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cheret devin deesse?KATHARINEYour majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive demost sage demoiselle dat is en France.KING HENRY VNow, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, intrue English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour Idare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins toflatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poorand untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrewmy father's ambition! he was thinking of civil warswhen he got me: therefore was I created with astubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, whenI come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up ofbeauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thouhast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thoushalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will youhave me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch thethoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I amthine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mineear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England isthine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and HarryPlantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it beforehis face, if he be not fellow with the best king,thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice ismusic and thy English broken; therefore, queen ofall, Katharine, break thy mind to me in brokenEnglish; wilt thou have me?KATHARINEDat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.KING HENRY VNay, it will please him well, Kate it shall pleasehim, Kate.KATHARINEDen it sall also content me.KING HENRY VUpon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.KATHARINELaissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, jene veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur enbaisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigneserviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, montres-puissant seigneur.KING HENRY VThen I will kiss your lips, Kate.KATHARINELes dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devantleur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.KING HENRY VMadam my interpreter, what says she?ALICEDat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies ofFrance,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.KING HENRY VTo kiss.ALICEYour majesty entendre bettre que moi.KING HENRY VIt is not a fashion for the maids in France to kissbefore they are married, would she say?ALICEOui, vraiment.KING HENRY VO Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. DearKate, you and I cannot be confined within the weaklist of a country's fashion: we are the makers ofmanners, Kate; and the liberty that follows ourplaces stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I willdo yours, for upholding the nice fashion of yourcountry in denying me a kiss: therefore, patientlyand yielding.Kissing herYou have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there ismore eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in thetongues of the French council; and they shouldsooner persuade Harry of England than a generalpetition of monarchs. Here comes your father.Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other LordsBURGUNDYGod save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach youour princess English?KING HENRY VI would have her learn, my fair cousin, howperfectly I love her; and that is good English.BURGUNDYIs she not apt?KING HENRY VOur tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is notsmooth; so that, having neither the voice nor theheart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure upthe spirit of love in her, that he will appear inhis true likeness.BURGUNDYPardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer youfor that. If you would conjure in her, you mustmake a circle; if conjure up love in her in his truelikeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can youblame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with thevirgin crimson of modesty, if she deny theappearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeingself? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maidto consign to.KING HENRY VYet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.BURGUNDYThey are then excused, my lord, when they see notwhat they do.KING HENRY VThen, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.BURGUNDYI will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you willteach her to know my meaning: for maids, wellsummered and warm kept, are like flies atBartholomew-tide, blind, though they have theireyes; and then they will endure handling, whichbefore would not abide looking on.KING HENRY VThis moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in thelatter end and she must be blind too.BURGUNDYAs love is, my lord, before it loves.KING HENRY VIt is so: and you may, some of you, thank love formy blindness, who cannot see many a fair French cityfor one fair French maid that stands in my way.FRENCH KINGYes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the citiesturned into a maid; for they are all girdled withmaiden walls that war hath never entered.KING HENRY VShall Kate be my wife?FRENCH KINGSo please you.KING HENRY VI am content; so the maiden cities you talk of maywait on her: so the maid that stood in the way formy wish shall show me the way to my will.FRENCH KINGWe have consented to all terms of reason.KING HENRY VIs't so, my lords of England?WESTMORELANDThe king hath granted every article:His daughter first, and then in sequel all,According to their firm proposed natures.EXETEROnly he hath not yet subscribed this:Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,having any occasion to write for matter of grant,shall name your highness in this form and with thisaddition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roid'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus inLatin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, RexAngliae, et Haeres Franciae.FRENCH KINGNor this I have not, brother, so denied,But your request shall make me let it pass.KING HENRY VI pray you then, in love and dear alliance,Let that one article rank with the rest;And thereupon give me your daughter.FRENCH KINGTake her, fair son, and from her blood raise upIssue to me; that the contending kingdomsOf France and England, whose very shores look paleWith envy of each other's happiness,May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunctionPlant neighbourhood and Christian-like accordIn their sweet bosoms, that never war advanceHis bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.ALLAmen!KING HENRY VNow, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.FlourishQUEEN ISABELGod, the best maker of all marriages,Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!As man and wife, being two, are one in love,So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,To make divorce of their incorporate league;That English may as French, French Englishmen,Receive each other. God speak this Amen!ALLAmen!KING HENRY VPrepare we for our marriage--on which day,My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!Sennet. ExeuntEPILOGUEEnter ChorusChorusThus far, with rough and all-unable pen,Our bending author hath pursued the story,In little room confining mighty men,Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.Small time, but in that small most greatly livedThis star of England: Fortune made his sword;By which the world's best garden be achieved,And of it left his son imperial lord.Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd KingOf France and England, did this king succeed;Whose state so many had the managing,That they lost France and made his England bleed:Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,In your fair minds let this acceptance take.Exit
