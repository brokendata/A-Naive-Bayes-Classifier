To cabin: silence! trouble us not.GONZALOGood, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.BoatswainNone that I more love than myself. You are acounsellor; if you can command these elements tosilence, and work the peace of the present, we willnot hand a rope more; use your authority: if youcannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and makeyourself ready in your cabin for the mischance ofthe hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Outof our way, I say.ExitGONZALOI have great comfort from this fellow: methinks hehath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion isperfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to hishanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,for our own doth little advantage.

Before PROSPERO'S cell.Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDAMIRANDAIf by your art, my dearest father, you havePut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,Dashes the fire out. O, I have sufferedWith those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knockAgainst my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.Had I been any god of power, I wouldHave sunk the sea within the earth or ereIt should the good ship so have swallow'd andThe fraughting souls within her.PROSPEROBe collected:No more amazement: tell your piteous heartThere's no harm done.MIRANDAO, woe the day!PROSPERONo harm.I have done nothing but in care of thee,Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, whoArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowingOf whence I am, nor that I am more betterThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,And thy no greater father.MIRANDAMore to knowDid never meddle with my thoughts.PROSPERO'Tis timeI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,And pluck my magic garment from me. So:Lays down his mantleLie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'dThe very virtue of compassion in thee,I have with such provision in mine artSo safely ordered that there is no soul--No, not so much perdition as an hairBetid to any creature in the vesselWhich thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;For thou must now know farther.MIRANDAYou have oftenBegun to tell me what I am, but stopp'dAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'PROSPEROThe hour's now come;The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;Obey and be attentive. Canst thou rememberA time before we came unto this cell?I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast notOut three years old.MIRANDACertainly, sir, I can.PROSPEROBy what? by any other house or person?Of any thing the image tell me thatHath kept with thy remembrance.MIRANDA'Tis far offAnd rather like a dream than an assuranceThat my remembrance warrants. Had I notFour or five women once that tended me?PROSPEROThou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is itThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou elseIn the dark backward and abysm of time?If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,How thou camest here thou mayst.MIRANDABut that I do not.PROSPEROTwelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,Thy father was the Duke of Milan andA prince of power.MIRANDASir, are not you my father?PROSPEROThy mother was a piece of virtue, andShe said thou wast my daughter; and thy fatherWas Duke of Milan; and thou his only heirAnd princess no worse issued.MIRANDAO the heavens!What foul play had we, that we came from thence?Or blessed was't we did?PROSPEROBoth, both, my girl:By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,But blessedly holp hither.MIRANDAO, my heart bleedsTo think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.PROSPEROMy brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--I pray thee, mark me--that a brother shouldBe so perfidious!--he whom next thyselfOf all the world I loved and to him putThe manage of my state; as at that timeThrough all the signories it was the firstAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputedIn dignity, and for the liberal artsWithout a parallel; those being all my study,The government I cast upon my brotherAnd to my state grew stranger, being transportedAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--Dost thou attend me?MIRANDASir, most heedfully.PROSPEROBeing once perfected how to grant suits,How to deny them, who to advance and whoTo trash for over-topping, new createdThe creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,Or else new form'd 'em; having both the keyOf officer and office, set all hearts i' the stateTo what tune pleased his ear; that now he wasThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.MIRANDAO, good sir, I do.PROSPEROI pray thee, mark me.I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicatedTo closeness and the bettering of my mindWith that which, but by being so retired,O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brotherAwaked an evil nature; and my trust,Like a good parent, did beget of himA falsehood in its contrary as greatAs my trust was; which had indeed no limit,A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,Not only with what my revenue yielded,But what my power might else exact, like oneWho having into truth, by telling of it,Made such a sinner of his memory,To credit his own lie, he did believeHe was indeed the duke; out o' the substitutionAnd executing the outward face of royalty,With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--Dost thou hear?MIRANDAYour tale, sir, would cure deafness.PROSPEROTo have no screen between this part he play'dAnd him he play'd it for, he needs will beAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my libraryWas dukedom large enough: of temporal royaltiesHe thinks me now incapable; confederates--So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of NaplesTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,Subject his coronet to his crown and bendThe dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--To most ignoble stooping.MIRANDAO the heavens!PROSPEROMark his condition and the event; then tell meIf this might be a brother.MIRANDAI should sinTo think but nobly of my grandmother:Good wombs have borne bad sons.PROSPERONow the condition.The King of Naples, being an enemyTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premisesOf homage and I know not how much tribute,Should presently extirpate me and mineOut of the dukedom and confer fair MilanWith all the honours on my brother: whereon,A treacherous army levied, one midnightFated to the purpose did Antonio openThe gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,The ministers for the purpose hurried thenceMe and thy crying self.MIRANDAAlack, for pity!I, not remembering how I cried out then,Will cry it o'er again: it is a hintThat wrings mine eyes to't.PROSPEROHear a little furtherAnd then I'll bring thee to the present businessWhich now's upon's; without the which this storyWere most impertinent.MIRANDAWherefore did they notThat hour destroy us?PROSPEROWell demanded, wench:My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,So dear the love my people bore me, nor setA mark so bloody on the business, butWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,Bore us some leagues to sea; where they preparedA rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very ratsInstinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sighTo the winds whose pity, sighing back again,Did us but loving wrong.MIRANDAAlack, what troubleWas I then to you!PROSPEROO, a cherubimThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.Infused with a fortitude from heaven,When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in meAn undergoing stomach, to bear upAgainst what should ensue.MIRANDAHow came we ashore?PROSPEROBy Providence divine.Some food we had and some fresh water thatA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,Out of his charity, being then appointedMaster of this design, did give us, withRich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd meFrom mine own library with volumes thatI prize above my dukedom.MIRANDAWould I mightBut ever see that man!PROSPERONow I arise:Resumes his mantleSit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.Here in this island we arrived; and hereHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profitThan other princesses can that have more timeFor vainer hours and tutors not so careful.MIRANDAHeavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reasonFor raising this sea-storm?PROSPEROKnow thus far forth.By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,Now my dear lady, hath mine enemiesBrought to this shore; and by my prescienceI find my zenith doth depend uponA most auspicious star, whose influenceIf now I court not but omit, my fortunesWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions:Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.MIRANDA sleepsCome away, servant, come. I am ready now.Approach, my Ariel, come.Enter ARIELARIELAll hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I comeTo answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,To swim, to dive into the fire, to rideOn the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding taskAriel and all his quality.PROSPEROHast thou, spirit,Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?ARIELTo every article.I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,And burn in many places; on the topmast,The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursorsO' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentaryAnd sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracksOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty NeptuneSeem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,Yea, his dread trident shake.PROSPEROMy brave spirit!Who was so firm, so constant, that this coilWould not infect his reason?ARIELNot a soulBut felt a fever of the mad and play'dSome tricks of desperation. All but marinersPlunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is emptyAnd all the devils are here.'PROSPEROWhy that's my spirit!But was not this nigh shore?ARIELClose by, my master.PROSPEROBut are they, Ariel, safe?ARIELNot a hair perish'd;On their sustaining garments not a blemish,But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.The king's son have I landed by himself;Whom I left cooling of the air with sighsIn an odd angle of the isle and sitting,His arms in this sad knot.PROSPEROOf the king's shipThe mariners say how thou hast disposedAnd all the rest o' the fleet.ARIELSafely in harbourIs the king's ship; in the deep nook, where onceThou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dewFrom the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:The mariners all under hatches stow'd;Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleetWhich I dispersed, they all have met againAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote,Bound sadly home for Naples,Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'dAnd his great person perish.PROSPEROAriel, thy chargeExactly is perform'd: but there's more work.What is the time o' the day?ARIELPast the mid season.PROSPEROAt least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and nowMust by us both be spent most preciously.ARIELIs there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,Which is not yet perform'd me.PROSPEROHow now? moody?What is't thou canst demand?ARIELMy liberty.PROSPEROBefore the time be out? no more!ARIELI prithee,Remember I have done thee worthy service;Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, servedWithout or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promiseTo bate me a full year.PROSPERODost thou forgetFrom what a torment I did free thee?ARIELNo.PROSPEROThou dost, and think'st it much to tread the oozeOf the salt deep,To run upon the sharp wind of the north,To do me business in the veins o' the earthWhen it is baked with frost.ARIELI do not, sir.PROSPEROThou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgotThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envyWas grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?ARIELNo, sir.PROSPEROThou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.ARIELSir, in Argier.PROSPEROO, was she so? I mustOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terribleTo enter human hearing, from Argier,Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she didThey would not take her life. Is not this true?ARIELAy, sir.PROSPEROThis blue-eyed hag was hither brought with childAnd here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;And, for thou wast a spirit too delicateTo act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,By help of her more potent ministersAnd in her most unmitigable rage,Into a cloven pine; within which riftImprison'd thou didst painfully remainA dozen years; within which space she diedAnd left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groansAs fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--Save for the son that she did litter here,A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd withA human shape.ARIELYes, Caliban her son.PROSPERODull thing, I say so; he, that CalibanWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know'stWhat torment I did find thee in; thy groansDid make wolves howl and penetrate the breastsOf ever angry bears: it was a tormentTo lay upon the damn'd, which SycoraxCould not again undo: it was mine art,When I arrived and heard thee, that made gapeThe pine and let thee out.ARIELI thank thee, master.PROSPEROIf thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oakAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails tillThou hast howl'd away twelve winters.ARIELPardon, master;I will be correspondent to commandAnd do my spiriting gently.PROSPERODo so, and after two daysI will discharge thee.ARIELThat's my noble master!What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?PROSPEROGo make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subjectTo no sight but thine and mine, invisibleTo every eyeball else. Go take this shapeAnd hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!Exit ARIELAwake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!MIRANDAThe strangeness of your story putHeaviness in me.PROSPEROShake it off. Come on;We'll visit Caliban my slave, who neverYields us kind answer.MIRANDA'Tis a villain, sir,I do not love to look on.PROSPEROBut, as 'tis,We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,Fetch in our wood and serves in officesThat profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!Thou earth, thou! speak.CALIBAN[Within]  There's wood enough within.PROSPEROCome forth, I say! there's other business for thee:Come, thou tortoise! when?Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymphFine apparition! My quaint Ariel,Hark in thine ear.ARIELMy lord it shall be done.ExitPROSPEROThou poisonous slave, got by the devil himselfUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!Enter CALIBANCALIBANAs wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'dWith raven's feather from unwholesome fenDrop on you both! a south-west blow on yeAnd blister you all o'er!PROSPEROFor this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchinsShall, for that vast of night that they may work,All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'dAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stingingThan bees that made 'em.CALIBANI must eat my dinner.This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give meWater with berries in't, and teach me howTo name the bigger light, and how the less,That burn by day and night: and then I loved theeAnd show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:Cursed be I that did so! All the charmsOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!For I am all the subjects that you have,Which first was mine own king: and here you sty meIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from meThe rest o' the island.PROSPEROThou most lying slave,Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged theeIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violateThe honour of my child.CALIBANO ho, O ho! would't had been done!Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled elseThis isle with Calibans.PROSPEROAbhorred slave,Which any print of goodness wilt not take,Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hourOne thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble likeA thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposesWith words that made them known. But thy vile race,Though thou didst learn, had that in't whichgood naturesCould not abide to be with; therefore wast thouDeservedly confined into this rock,Who hadst deserved more than a prison.CALIBANYou taught me language; and my profit on'tIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid youFor learning me your language!PROSPEROHag-seed, hence!Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?If thou neglect'st or dost unwillinglyWhat I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roarThat beasts shall tremble at thy din.CALIBANNo, pray thee.AsideI must obey: his art is of such power,It would control my dam's god, Setebos,and make a vassal of him.PROSPEROSo, slave; hence!Exit CALIBANRe-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND followingARIEL'S song.Come unto these yellow sands,And then take hands:Courtsied when you have and kiss'dThe wild waves whist,Foot it featly here and there;And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.Hark, hark!Burthen [dispersedly, withinThe watch-dogs bark!Burthen Bow-wowHark, hark! I hearThe strain of strutting chanticleerCry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.FERDINANDWhere should this music be? i' the air or the earth?It sounds no more: and sure, it waits uponSome god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,Weeping again the king my father's wreck,This music crept by me upon the waters,Allaying both their fury and my passionWith its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.No, it begins again.ARIEL singsFull fathom five thy father lies;Of his bones are coral made;Those are pearls that were his eyes:Nothing of him that doth fadeBut doth suffer a sea-changeInto something rich and strange.Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knellBurthen Ding-dongHark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.FERDINANDThe ditty does remember my drown'd father.This is no mortal business, nor no soundThat the earth owes. I hear it now above me.PROSPEROThe fringed curtains of thine eye advanceAnd say what thou seest yond.MIRANDAWhat is't? a spirit?Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.PROSPERONo, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such sensesAs we have, such. This gallant which thou seestWas in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'dWith grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call himA goodly person: he hath lost his fellowsAnd strays about to find 'em.MIRANDAI might call himA thing divine, for nothing naturalI ever saw so noble.PROSPERO[Aside] It goes on, I see,As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free theeWithin two days for this.FERDINANDMost sure, the goddessOn whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayerMay know if you remain upon this island;And that you will some good instruction giveHow I may bear me here: my prime request,Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!If you be maid or no?MIRANDANo wonder, sir;But certainly a maid.FERDINANDMy language! heavens!I am the best of them that speak this speech,Were I but where 'tis spoken.PROSPEROHow? the best?What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?FERDINANDA single thing, as I am now, that wondersTo hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheldThe king my father wreck'd.MIRANDAAlack, for mercy!FERDINANDYes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of MilanAnd his brave son being twain.PROSPERO[Aside]	The Duke of MilanAnd his more braver daughter could control thee,If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sightThey have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,I'll set thee free for this.To FERDINANDA word, good sir;I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.MIRANDAWhy speaks my father so ungently? ThisIs the third man that e'er I saw, the firstThat e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my fatherTo be inclined my way!FERDINANDO, if a virgin,And your affection not gone forth, I'll make youThe queen of Naples.PROSPEROSoft, sir! one word more.AsideThey are both in either's powers; but this swift businessI must uneasy make, lest too light winningMake the prize light.To FERDINANDOne word more; I charge theeThat thou attend me: thou dost here usurpThe name thou owest not; and hast put thyselfUpon this island as a spy, to win itFrom me, the lord on't.FERDINANDNo, as I am a man.MIRANDAThere's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:If the ill spirit have so fair a house,Good things will strive to dwell with't.PROSPEROFollow me.Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall beThe fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husksWherein the acorn cradled. Follow.FERDINANDNo;I will resist such entertainment tillMine enemy has more power.Draws, and is charmed from movingMIRANDAO dear father,Make not too rash a trial of him, forHe's gentle and not fearful.PROSPEROWhat? I say,My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscienceIs so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,For I can here disarm thee with this stickAnd make thy weapon drop.MIRANDABeseech you, father.PROSPEROHence! hang not on my garments.MIRANDASir, have pity;I'll be his surety.PROSPEROSilence! one word moreShall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!An advocate for an imposter! hush!Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!To the most of men this is a CalibanAnd they to him are angels.MIRANDAMy affectionsAre then most humble; I have no ambitionTo see a goodlier man.PROSPEROCome on; obey:Thy nerves are in their infancy againAnd have no vigour in them.FERDINANDSo they are;My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,Might I but through my prison once a dayBehold this maid: all corners else o' the earthLet liberty make use of; space enoughHave I in such a prison.PROSPERO[Aside]                It works.To FERDINANDCome on.Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!To FERDINANDFollow me.To ARIELHark what thou else shalt do me.MIRANDABe of comfort;My father's of a better nature, sir,Than he appears by speech: this is unwontedWhich now came from him.PROSPEROThou shalt be freeAs mountain winds: but then exactly doAll points of my command.ARIELTo the syllable.PROSPEROCome, follow. Speak not for him.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. Another part of the island.Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and othersGONZALOBeseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,So have we all, of joy; for our escapeIs much beyond our loss. Our hint of woeIs common; every day some sailor's wife,The masters of some merchant and the merchantHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,I mean our preservation, few in millionsCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weighOur sorrow with our comfort.ALONSOPrithee, peace.SEBASTIANHe receives comfort like cold porridge.ANTONIOThe visitor will not give him o'er so.SEBASTIANLook he's winding up the watch of his wit;by and by it will strike.GONZALOSir,--SEBASTIANOne: tell.GONZALOWhen every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,Comes to the entertainer--SEBASTIANA dollar.GONZALODolour comes to him, indeed: youhave spoken truer than you purposed.SEBASTIANYou have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.GONZALOTherefore, my lord,--ANTONIOFie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!ALONSOI prithee, spare.GONZALOWell, I have done: but yet,--SEBASTIANHe will be talking.ANTONIOWhich, of he or Adrian, for a goodwager, first begins to crow?SEBASTIANThe old cock.ANTONIOThe cockerel.SEBASTIANDone. The wager?ANTONIOA laughter.SEBASTIANA match!ADRIANThough this island seem to be desert,--SEBASTIANHa, ha, ha! So, you're paid.ADRIANUninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--SEBASTIANYet,--ADRIANYet,--ANTONIOHe could not miss't.ADRIANIt must needs be of subtle, tender and delicatetemperance.ANTONIOTemperance was a delicate wench.SEBASTIANAy, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.ADRIANThe air breathes upon us here most sweetly.SEBASTIANAs if it had lungs and rotten ones.ANTONIOOr as 'twere perfumed by a fen.GONZALOHere is everything advantageous to life.ANTONIOTrue; save means to live.SEBASTIANOf that there's none, or little.GONZALOHow lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!ANTONIOThe ground indeed is tawny.SEBASTIANWith an eye of green in't.ANTONIOHe misses not much.SEBASTIANNo; he doth but mistake the truth totally.GONZALOBut the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almostbeyond credit,--SEBASTIANAs many vouched rarities are.GONZALOThat our garments, being, as they were, drenched inthe sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness andglosses, being rather new-dyed than stained withsalt water.ANTONIOIf but one of his pockets could speak, would it notsay he lies?SEBASTIANAy, or very falsely pocket up his reportGONZALOMethinks our garments are now as fresh as when weput them on first in Afric, at the marriage ofthe king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.SEBASTIAN'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.ADRIANTunis was never graced before with such a paragon totheir queen.GONZALONot since widow Dido's time.ANTONIOWidow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?widow Dido!SEBASTIANWhat if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,how you take it!ADRIAN'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.GONZALOThis Tunis, sir, was Carthage.ADRIANCarthage?GONZALOI assure you, Carthage.SEBASTIANHis word is more than the miraculous harp; he hathraised the wall and houses too.ANTONIOWhat impossible matter will he make easy next?SEBASTIANI think he will carry this island home in his pocketand give it his son for an apple.ANTONIOAnd, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bringforth more islands.GONZALOAy.ANTONIOWhy, in good time.GONZALOSir, we were talking that our garments seem nowas fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriageof your daughter, who is now queen.ANTONIOAnd the rarest that e'er came there.SEBASTIANBate, I beseech you, widow Dido.ANTONIOO, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.GONZALOIs not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day Iwore it? I mean, in a sort.ANTONIOThat sort was well fished for.GONZALOWhen I wore it at your daughter's marriage?ALONSOYou cram these words into mine ears againstThe stomach of my sense. Would I had neverMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,Who is so far from Italy removedI ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heirOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fishHath made his meal on thee?FRANCISCOSir, he may live:I saw him beat the surges under him,And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,Whose enmity he flung aside, and breastedThe surge most swoln that met him; his bold head'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'dHimself with his good arms in lusty strokeTo the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,As stooping to relieve him: I not doubtHe came alive to land.ALONSONo, no, he's gone.SEBASTIANSir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,But rather lose her to an African;Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.ALONSOPrithee, peace.SEBASTIANYou were kneel'd to and importuned otherwiseBy all of us, and the fair soul herselfWeigh'd between loathness and obedience, atWhich end o' the beam should bow. We have lost yourson,I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples haveMore widows in them of this business' makingThan we bring men to comfort them:The fault's your own.ALONSOSo is the dear'st o' the loss.GONZALOMy lord Sebastian,The truth you speak doth lack some gentlenessAnd time to speak it in: you rub the sore,When you should bring the plaster.SEBASTIANVery well.ANTONIOAnd most chirurgeonly.GONZALOIt is foul weather in us all, good sir,When you are cloudy.SEBASTIANFoul weather?ANTONIOVery foul.GONZALOHad I plantation of this isle, my lord,--ANTONIOHe'ld sow't with nettle-seed.SEBASTIANOr docks, or mallows.GONZALOAnd were the king on't, what would I do?SEBASTIAN'Scape being drunk for want of wine.GONZALOI' the commonwealth I would by contrariesExecute all things; for no kind of trafficWould I admit; no name of magistrate;Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,And use of service, none; contract, succession,Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;No occupation; all men idle, all;And women too, but innocent and pure;No sovereignty;--SEBASTIANYet he would be king on't.ANTONIOThe latter end of his commonwealth forgets thebeginning.GONZALOAll things in common nature should produceWithout sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,To feed my innocent people.SEBASTIANNo marrying 'mong his subjects?ANTONIONone, man; all idle: whores and knaves.GONZALOI would with such perfection govern, sir,To excel the golden age.SEBASTIANGod save his majesty!ANTONIOLong live Gonzalo!GONZALOAnd,--do you mark me, sir?ALONSOPrithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.GONZALOI do well believe your highness; anddid it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,who are of such sensible and nimble lungs thatthey always use to laugh at nothing.ANTONIO'Twas you we laughed at.GONZALOWho in this kind of merry fooling am nothingto you: so you may continue and laugh atnothing still.ANTONIOWhat a blow was there given!SEBASTIANAn it had not fallen flat-long.GONZALOYou are gentlemen of brave metal; you would liftthe moon out of her sphere, if she would continuein it five weeks without changing.Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn musicSEBASTIANWe would so, and then go a bat-fowling.ANTONIONay, good my lord, be not angry.GONZALONo, I warrant you; I will not adventuremy discretion so weakly. Will you laughme asleep, for I am very heavy?ANTONIOGo sleep, and hear us.All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIOALONSOWhat, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyesWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I findThey are inclined to do so.SEBASTIANPlease you, sir,Do not omit the heavy offer of it:It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,It is a comforter.ANTONIOWe two, my lord,Will guard your person while you take your rest,And watch your safety.ALONSOThank you. Wondrous heavy.ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIELSEBASTIANWhat a strange drowsiness possesses them!ANTONIOIt is the quality o' the climate.SEBASTIANWhyDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find notMyself disposed to sleep.ANTONIONor I; my spirits are nimble.They fell together all, as by consent;They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, andMy strong imagination sees a crownDropping upon thy head.SEBASTIANWhat, art thou waking?ANTONIODo you not hear me speak?SEBASTIANI do; and surelyIt is a sleepy language and thou speak'stOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?This is a strange repose, to be asleepWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,And yet so fast asleep.ANTONIONoble Sebastian,Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'stWhiles thou art waking.SEBASTIANThou dost snore distinctly;There's meaning in thy snores.ANTONIOI am more serious than my custom: youMust be so too, if heed me; which to doTrebles thee o'er.SEBASTIANWell, I am standing water.ANTONIOI'll teach you how to flow.SEBASTIANDo so: to ebbHereditary sloth instructs me.ANTONIOO,If you but knew how you the purpose cherishWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,Most often do so near the bottom runBy their own fear or sloth.SEBASTIANPrithee, say on:The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaimA matter from thee, and a birth indeedWhich throes thee much to yield.ANTONIOThus, sir:Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,Who shall be of as little memoryWhen he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--For he's a spirit of persuasion, onlyProfesses to persuade,--the king his son's alive,'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'dAnd he that sleeps here swims.SEBASTIANI have no hopeThat he's undrown'd.ANTONIOO, out of that 'no hope'What great hope have you! no hope that way isAnother way so high a hope that evenAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with meThat Ferdinand is drown'd?SEBASTIANHe's gone.ANTONIOThen, tell me,Who's the next heir of Naples?SEBASTIANClaribel.ANTONIOShe that is queen of Tunis; she that dwellsTen leagues beyond man's life; she that from NaplesCan have no note, unless the sun were post--The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chinsBe rough and razorable; she that--from whom?We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,And by that destiny to perform an actWhereof what's past is prologue, what to comeIn yours and my discharge.SEBASTIANWhat stuff is this! how say you?'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regionsThere is some space.ANTONIOA space whose every cubitSeems to cry out, 'How shall that ClaribelMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were deathThat now hath seized them; why, they were no worseThan now they are. There be that can rule NaplesAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prateAs amply and unnecessarilyAs this Gonzalo; I myself could makeA chough of as deep chat. O, that you boreThe mind that I do! what a sleep were thisFor your advancement! Do you understand me?SEBASTIANMethinks I do.ANTONIOAnd how does your contentTender your own good fortune?SEBASTIANI rememberYou did supplant your brother Prospero.ANTONIOTrue:And look how well my garments sit upon me;Much feater than before: my brother's servantsWere then my fellows; now they are my men.SEBASTIANBut, for your conscience?ANTONIOAy, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel notThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be theyAnd melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,No better than the earth he lies upon,If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,To the perpetual wink for aye might putThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, whoShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;They'll tell the clock to any business thatWe say befits the hour.SEBASTIANThy case, dear friend,Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one strokeShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;And I the king shall love thee.ANTONIODraw together;And when I rear my hand, do you the like,To fall it on Gonzalo.SEBASTIANO, but one word.They talk apartRe-enter ARIEL, invisibleARIELMy master through his art foresees the dangerThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--For else his project dies--to keep them living.Sings in GONZALO's earWhile you here do snoring lie,Open-eyed conspiracyHis time doth take.If of life you keep a care,Shake off slumber, and beware:Awake, awake!ANTONIOThen let us both be sudden.GONZALONow, good angelsPreserve the king.They wakeALONSOWhy, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?Wherefore this ghastly looking?GONZALOWhat's the matter?SEBASTIANWhiles we stood here securing your repose,Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowingLike bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?It struck mine ear most terribly.ALONSOI heard nothing.ANTONIOO, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roarOf a whole herd of lions.ALONSOHeard you this, Gonzalo?GONZALOUpon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,And that a strange one too, which did awake me:I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.ALONSOLead off this ground; and let's make further searchFor my poor son.GONZALOHeavens keep him from these beasts!For he is, sure, i' the island.ALONSOLead away.ARIELProspero my lord shall know what I have done:So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.ExeuntSCENE II.

But they'll nor pinch,Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the darkOut of my way, unless he bid 'em; butFor every trifle are they set upon me;Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at meAnd after bite me, then like hedgehogs whichLie tumbling in my barefoot way and mountTheir pricks at my footfall; sometime am IAll wound with adders who with cloven tonguesDo hiss me into madness.Enter TRINCULOLo, now, lo!Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment meFor bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;Perchance he will not mind me.TRINCULOHere's neither bush nor shrub, to bear offany weather at all, and another storm brewing;I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same blackcloud, yond huge one, looks like a foulbombard that would shed his liquor. If itshould thunder as it did before, I know notwhere to hide my head: yond same cloud cannotchoose but fall by pailfuls. What have wehere? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,as once I was, and had but this fish painted,not a holiday fool there but would give a pieceof silver: there would this monster make aman; any strange beast there makes a man:when they will not give a doit to relieve a lamebeggar, they will lazy out ten to see a deadIndian. Legged like a man and his fins likearms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loosemy opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,but an islander, that hath lately suffered by athunderbolt.ThunderAlas, the storm is come again! my best way is tocreep under his gaberdine; there is no othershelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man withstrange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till thedregs of the storm be past.Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his handSTEPHANOI shall no more to sea, to sea,Here shall I die ashore--This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man'sfuneral: well, here's my comfort.DrinksSingsThe master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,The gunner and his mateLoved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,But none of us cared for Kate;For she had a tongue with a tang,Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.DrinksCALIBANDo not torment me: Oh!STEPHANOWhat's the matter?

Ihave not scaped drowning to be afeard now of yourfour legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man asever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;and it shall be said so again while Stephanobreathes at's nostrils.CALIBANThe spirit torments me; Oh!STEPHANOThis is some monster of the isle with four legs, whohath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devilshould he learn our language? I will give him somerelief, if it be but for that. if I can recover himand keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's apresent for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.CALIBANDo not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.STEPHANOHe's in his fit now and does not talk after thewisest.

Mercy upon us!CALIBANArt thou afeard?STEPHANONo, monster, not I.CALIBANBe not afeard; the isle is full of noises,Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.Sometimes a thousand twangling instrumentsWill hum about mine ears, and sometime voicesThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,The clouds methought would open and show richesReady to drop upon me that, when I waked,I cried to dream again.STEPHANOThis will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shallhave my music for nothing.CALIBANWhen Prospero is destroyed.STEPHANOThat shall be by and by: I remember the story.TRINCULOThe sound is going away; let's follow it, andafter do our work.STEPHANOLead, monster; we'll follow.

Well, let him go.ANTONIO[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's soout of hope.Do not, for one repulse, forego the purposeThat you resolved to effect.SEBASTIAN[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantageWill we take throughly.ANTONIO[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;For, now they are oppress'd with travel, theyWill not, nor cannot, use such vigilanceAs when they are fresh.SEBASTIAN[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.Solemn and strange musicALONSOWhat harmony is this?

I and my fellowsAre ministers of Fate: the elements,Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as wellWound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabsKill the still-closing waters, as diminishOne dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministersAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,Your swords are now too massy for your strengthsAnd will not be uplifted. But remember--For that's my business to you--that you threeFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero;Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,Him and his innocent child: for which foul deedThe powers, delaying, not forgetting, haveIncensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:Lingering perdition, worse than any deathCan be at once, shall step by step attendYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--Which here, in this most desolate isle, else fallsUpon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrowAnd a clear life ensuing.He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music  enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the tablePROSPEROBravely the figure of this harpy hast thouPerform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:Of my instruction hast thou nothing batedIn what thou hadst to say: so, with good lifeAnd observation strange, my meaner ministersTheir several kinds have done.

Then I beat my tabour;At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'dtheir ears,Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their nosesAs they smelt music: so I charm'd their earsThat calf-like they my lowing follow'd throughTooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,Which entered their frail shins: at last I left themI' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lakeO'erstunk their feet.PROSPEROThis was well done, my bird.Thy shape invisible retain thou still:The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,For stale to catch these thieves.ARIELI go, I go.ExitPROSPEROA devil, a born devil, on whose natureNurture can never stick; on whom my pains,Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;And as with age his body uglier grows,So his mind cankers.

Say, my spirit,How fares the king and's followers?ARIELConfined togetherIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;They cannot budge till your release. The king,His brother and yours, abide all three distractedAnd the remainder mourning over them,Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chieflyHim that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'His tears run down his beard, like winter's dropsFrom eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'emThat if you now beheld them, your affectionsWould become tender.PROSPERODost thou think so, spirit?ARIELMine would, sir, were I human.PROSPEROAnd mine shall.Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feelingOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my furyDo I take part: the rarer action isIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,The sole drift of my purpose doth extendNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,And they shall be themselves.ARIELI'll fetch them, sir.ExitPROSPEROYe elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,And ye that on the sands with printless footDo chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly himWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets thatBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastimeIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoiceTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'dThe noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vaultSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunderHave I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oakWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontoryHave I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd upThe pine and cedar: graves at my commandHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forthBy my so potent art. But this rough magicI here abjure, and, when I have requiredSome heavenly music, which even now I do,To work mine end upon their senses thatThis airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,And deeper than did ever plummet soundI'll drown my book.Solemn musicRe-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a  frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;  SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all  enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,  and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:A solemn air and the best comforterTo an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,For you are spell-stopp'd.Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,And as the morning steals upon the night,Melting the darkness, so their rising sensesBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantleTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,My true preserver, and a loyal sirTo him you follow'st! I will pay thy gracesHome both in word and deed. Most cruellyDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,Unnatural though thou art. Their understandingBegins to swell, and the approaching tideWill shortly fill the reasonable shoreThat now lies foul and muddy. Not one of themThat yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:I will discase me, and myself presentAs I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;Thou shalt ere long be free.ARIEL sings and helps to attire himWhere the bee sucks. there suck I:In a cowslip's bell I lie;There I couch when owls do cry.On the bat's back I do flyAfter summer merrily.Merrily, merrily shall I live nowUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.PROSPEROWhy, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:There shalt thou find the mariners asleepUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswainBeing awake, enforce them to this place,And presently, I prithee.ARIELI drink the air before me, and returnOr ere your pulse twice beat.ExitGONZALOAll torment, trouble, wonder and amazementInhabits here: some heavenly power guide usOut of this fearful country!PROSPEROBehold, sir king,The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:For more assurance that a living princeDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;And to thee and thy company I bidA hearty welcome.ALONSOWhether thou best he or no,Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,As late I have been, I not know: thy pulseBeats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,The affliction of my mind amends, with which,I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,An if this be at all, a most strange story.Thy dukedom I resign and do entreatThou pardon me my wrongs. But how should ProsperoBe living and be here?PROSPEROFirst, noble friend,Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannotBe measured or confined.GONZALOWhether this beOr be not, I'll not swear.PROSPEROYou do yet tasteSome subtilties o' the isle, that will not let youBelieve things certain.

When did you lose your daughter?PROSPEROIn this last tempest. I perceive these lordsAt this encounter do so much admireThat they devour their reason and scarce thinkTheir eyes do offices of truth, their wordsAre natural breath: but, howsoe'er you haveBeen justled from your senses, know for certainThat I am Prospero and that very dukeWhich was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangelyUpon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,Not a relation for a breakfast norBefitting this first meeting.

SheIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,Of whom so often I have heard renown,But never saw before; of whom I haveReceived a second life; and second fatherThis lady makes him to me.ALONSOI am hers:But, O, how oddly will it sound that IMust ask my child forgiveness!PROSPEROThere, sir, stop:Let us not burthen our remembrance withA heaviness that's gone.GONZALOI have inly wept,Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,And on this couple drop a blessed crown!For it is you that have chalk'd forth the wayWhich brought us hither.ALONSOI say, Amen, Gonzalo!GONZALOWas Milan thrust from Milan, that his issueShould become kings of Naples? O, rejoiceBeyond a common joy, and set it downWith gold on lasting pillars: In one voyageDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wifeWhere he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedomIn a poor isle and all of us ourselvesWhen no man was his own.ALONSO[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heartThat doth not wish you joy!GONZALOBe it so!

I am afraidHe will chastise me.SEBASTIANHa, ha!What things are these, my lord Antonio?Will money buy 'em?ANTONIOVery like; one of themIs a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.PROSPEROMark but the badges of these men, my lords,Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,His mother was a witch, and one so strongThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,And deal in her command without her power.These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--For he's a bastard one--had plotted with themTo take my life. Two of these fellows youMust know and own; this thing of darkness!Acknowledge mine.CALIBANI shall be pinch'd to death.ALONSOIs not this Stephano, my drunken butler?SEBASTIANHe is drunk now: where had he wine?ALONSOAnd Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should theyFind this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?How camest thou in this pickle?TRINCULOI have been in such a pickle since Isaw you last that, I fear me, will never out ofmy bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.SEBASTIANWhy, how now, Stephano!STEPHANOO, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.PROSPEROYou'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?STEPHANOI should have been a sore one then.ALONSOThis is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.Pointing to CalibanPROSPEROHe is as disproportion'd in his mannersAs in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;Take with you your companions; as you lookTo have my pardon, trim it handsomely.CALIBANAy, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafterAnd seek for grace. What a thrice-double assWas I, to take this drunkard for a godAnd worship this dull fool!PROSPEROGo to; away!ALONSOHence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.SEBASTIANOr stole it, rather.Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULOPROSPEROSir, I invite your highness and your trainTo my poor cell, where you shall take your restFor this one night; which, part of it, I'll wasteWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make itGo quick away; the story of my lifeAnd the particular accidents gone bySince I came to this isle: and in the mornI'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,Where I have hope to see the nuptialOf these our dear-beloved solemnized;And thence retire me to my Milan, whereEvery third thought shall be my grave.ALONSOI longTo hear the story of your life, which mustTake the ear strangely.PROSPEROI'll deliver all;And promise you calm seas, auspicious galesAnd sail so expeditious that shall catchYour royal fleet far off.Aside to ARIELMy Ariel, chick,That is thy charge: then to the elementsBe free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.ExeuntEPILOGUESPOKEN BY PROSPERONow my charms are all o'erthrown,And what strength I have's mine own,Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,I must be here confined by you,Or sent to Naples. Let me not,Since I have my dukedom gotAnd pardon'd the deceiver, dwellIn this bare island by your spell;But release me from my bandsWith the help of your good hands:Gentle breath of yours my sailsMust fill, or else my project fails,Which was to please. Now I wantSpirits to enforce, art to enchant,And my ending is despair,Unless I be relieved by prayer,Which pierces so that it assaultsMercy itself and frees all faults.As you from crimes would pardon'd be,Let your indulgence set me free.
