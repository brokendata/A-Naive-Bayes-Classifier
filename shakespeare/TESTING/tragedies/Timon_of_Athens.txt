ACT ISCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doorsPoetGood day, sir.PainterI am glad you're well.PoetI have not seen you long: how goes the world?PainterIt wears, sir, as it grows.PoetAy, that's well known:But what particular rarity? what strange,Which manifold record not matches? See,Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy powerHath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.PainterI know them both; th' other's a jeweller.MerchantO, 'tis a worthy lord.JewellerNay, that's most fix'd.MerchantA most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,To an untirable and continuate goodness:He passes.Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--MerchantO, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--Poet[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense havepraised the vile,It stains the glory in that happy verseWhich aptly sings the good.'Merchant'Tis a good form.Looking at the jewelJewellerAnd rich: here is a water, look ye.PainterYou are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedicationTo the great lord.PoetA thing slipp'd idly from me.Our poesy is as a gum, which oozesFrom whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flintShows not till it be struck; our gentle flameProvokes itself and like the current fliesEach bound it chafes. What have you there?PainterA picture, sir. When comes your book forth?PoetUpon the heels of my presentment, sir.Let's see your piece.Painter'Tis a good piece.PoetSo 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.PainterIndifferent.PoetAdmirable: how this graceSpeaks his own standing! what a mental powerThis eye shoots forth! how big imaginationMoves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gestureOne might interpret.PainterIt is a pretty mocking of the life.Here is a touch; is't good?PoetI will say of it,It tutors nature: artificial strifeLives in these touches, livelier than life.Enter certain Senators, and pass overPainterHow this lord is follow'd!PoetThe senators of Athens: happy man!PainterLook, more!PoetYou see this confluence, this great floodof visitors.I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hugWith amplest entertainment: my free driftHalts not particularly, but moves itselfIn a wide sea of wax: no levell'd maliceInfects one comma in the course I hold;But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,Leaving no tract behind.PainterHow shall I understand you?PoetI will unbolt to you.You see how all conditions, how all minds,As well of glib and slippery creatures asOf grave and austere quality, tender downTheir services to Lord Timon: his large fortuneUpon his good and gracious nature hangingSubdues and properties to his love and tendanceAll sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flattererTo Apemantus, that few things loves betterThan to abhor himself: even he drops downThe knee before him, and returns in peaceMost rich in Timon's nod.PainterI saw them speak together.PoetSir, I have upon a high and pleasant hillFeign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mountIs rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,That labour on the bosom of this sphereTo propagate their states: amongst them all,Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;Whose present grace to present slaves and servantsTranslates his rivals.Painter'Tis conceived to scope.This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,With one man beckon'd from the rest below,Bowing his head against the sleepy mountTo climb his happiness, would be well express'dIn our condition.PoetNay, sir, but hear me on.All those which were his fellows but of late,Some better than his value, on the momentFollow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,Make sacred even his stirrup, and through himDrink the free air.PainterAy, marry, what of these?PoetWhen Fortune in her shift and change of moodSpurns down her late beloved, all his dependantsWhich labour'd after him to the mountain's topEven on their knees and hands, let him slip down,Not one accompanying his declining foot.Painter'Tis common:A thousand moral paintings I can showThat shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune'sMore pregnantly than words. Yet you do wellTo show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seenThe foot above the head.Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself  courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from  VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other servants followingTIMONImprison'd is he, say you?MessengerAy, my good lord: five talents is his debt,His means most short, his creditors most strait:Your honourable letter he desiresTo those have shut him up; which failing,Periods his comfort.TIMONNoble Ventidius! Well;I am not of that feather to shake offMy friend when he must need me. I do know himA gentleman that well deserves a help:Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,and free him.MessengerYour lordship ever binds him.TIMONCommend me to him: I will send his ransom;And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,But to support him after. Fare you well.MessengerAll happiness to your honour!ExitEnter an old AthenianOld AthenianLord Timon, hear me speak.TIMONFreely, good father.Old AthenianThou hast a servant named Lucilius.TIMONI have so: what of him?Old AthenianMost noble Timon, call the man before thee.TIMONAttends he here, or no? Lucilius!LUCILIUSHere, at your lordship's service.Old AthenianThis fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,By night frequents my house. I am a manThat from my first have been inclined to thrift;And my estate deserves an heir more raisedThan one which holds a trencher.TIMONWell; what further?Old AthenianOne only daughter have I, no kin else,On whom I may confer what I have got:The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,And I have bred her at my dearest costIn qualities of the best. This man of thineAttempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,Join with me to forbid him her resort;Myself have spoke in vain.TIMONThe man is honest.Old AthenianTherefore he will be, Timon:His honesty rewards him in itself;It must not bear my daughter.TIMONDoes she love him?Old AthenianShe is young and apt:Our own precedent passions do instruct usWhat levity's in youth.TIMON[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?LUCILIUSAy, my good lord, and she accepts of it.Old AthenianIf in her marriage my consent be missing,I call the gods to witness, I will chooseMine heir from forth the beggars of the world,And dispossess her all.TIMONHow shall she be endow'd,if she be mated with an equal husband?Old AthenianThree talents on the present; in future, all.TIMONThis gentleman of mine hath served me long:To build his fortune I will strain a little,For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,And make him weigh with her.Old AthenianMost noble lord,Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.TIMONMy hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.LUCILIUSHumbly I thank your lordship: never mayThe state or fortune fall into my keeping,Which is not owed to you!Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old AthenianPoetVouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!TIMONI thank you; you shall hear from me anon:Go not away. What have you there, my friend?PainterA piece of painting, which I do beseechYour lordship to accept.TIMONPainting is welcome.The painting is almost the natural man;or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,He is but outside: these pencill'd figures areEven such as they give out. I like your work;And you shall find I like it: wait attendanceTill you hear further from me.PainterThe gods preserve ye!TIMONWell fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewelHath suffer'd under praise.JewellerWhat, my lord! dispraise?TIMONA more satiety of commendations.If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,It would unclew me quite.JewellerMy lord, 'tis ratedAs those which sell would give: but you well know,Things of like value differing in the ownersAre prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,You mend the jewel by the wearing it.TIMONWell mock'd.MerchantNo, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,Which all men speak with him.TIMONLook, who comes here: will you be chid?Enter APEMANTUSJeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.MerchantHe'll spare none.TIMONGood morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!APEMANTUSTill I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.TIMONWhy dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.APEMANTUSAre they not Athenians?TIMONYes.APEMANTUSThen I repent not.Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?APEMANTUSThou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.TIMONThou art proud, Apemantus.APEMANTUSOf nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.TIMONWhither art going?APEMANTUSTo knock out an honest Athenian's brains.TIMONThat's a deed thou'lt die for.APEMANTUSRight, if doing nothing be death by the law.TIMONHow likest thou this picture, Apemantus?APEMANTUSThe best, for the innocence.TIMONWrought he not well that painted it?APEMANTUSHe wrought better that made the painter; and yethe's but a filthy piece of work.PainterYou're a dog.APEMANTUSThy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?TIMONWilt dine with me, Apemantus?APEMANTUSNo; I eat not lords.TIMONAn thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.APEMANTUSO, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.TIMONThat's a lascivious apprehension.APEMANTUSSo thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.TIMONHow dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?APEMANTUSNot so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost aman a doit.TIMONWhat dost thou think 'tis worth?APEMANTUSNot worth my thinking. How now, poet!PoetHow now, philosopher!APEMANTUSThou liest.PoetArt not one?APEMANTUSYes.PoetThen I lie not.APEMANTUSArt not a poet?PoetYes.APEMANTUSThen thou liest: look in thy last work, where thouhast feigned him a worthy fellow.PoetThat's not feigned; he is so.APEMANTUSYes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thylabour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!TIMONWhat wouldst do then, Apemantus?APEMANTUSE'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.TIMONWhat, thyself?APEMANTUSAy.TIMONWherefore?APEMANTUSThat I had no angry wit to be a lord.Art not thou a merchant?MerchantAy, Apemantus.APEMANTUSTraffic confound thee, if the gods will not!MerchantIf traffic do it, the gods do it.APEMANTUSTraffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!Trumpet sounds. Enter a MessengerTIMONWhat trumpet's that?Messenger'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,All of companionship.TIMONPray, entertain them; give them guide to us.Exeunt some AttendantsYou must needs dine with me: go not you henceTill I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.Enter ALCIBIADES, with the restMost welcome, sir!APEMANTUSSo, so, there!Aches contract and starve your supple joints!That there should be small love 'mongst thesesweet knaves,And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred outInto baboon and monkey.ALCIBIADESSir, you have saved my longing, and I feedMost hungerly on your sight.TIMONRight welcome, sir!Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous timeIn different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.Exeunt all except APEMANTUSEnter two LordsFirst LordWhat time o' day is't, Apemantus?APEMANTUSTime to be honest.First LordThat time serves still.APEMANTUSThe more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.Second LordThou art going to Lord Timon's feast?APEMANTUSAy, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.Second LordFare thee well, fare thee well.APEMANTUSThou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.Second LordWhy, Apemantus?APEMANTUSShouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean togive thee none.First LordHang thyself!APEMANTUSNo, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thyrequests to thy friend.Second LordAway, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!APEMANTUSI will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.ExitFirst LordHe's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoesThe very heart of kindness.Second LordHe pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,Is but his steward: no meed, but he repaysSevenfold above itself; no gift to him,But breeds the giver a return exceedingAll use of quittance.First LordThe noblest mind he carriesThat ever govern'd man.Second LordLong may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?First LordI'll keep you company.ExeuntSCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter  TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.  Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himselfVENTIDIUSMost honour'd Timon,It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,And call him to long peace.He is gone happy, and has left me rich:Then, as in grateful virtue I am boundTo your free heart, I do return those talents,Doubled with thanks and service, from whose helpI derived liberty.TIMONO, by no means,Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:I gave it freely ever; and there's noneCan truly say he gives, if he receives:If our betters play at that game, we must not dareTo imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.VENTIDIUSA noble spirit!TIMONNay, my lords,They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMONCeremony was but devised at firstTo set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;But where there is true friendship, there needs none.Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunesThan my fortunes to me.They sitFirst LordMy lord, we always have confess'd it.APEMANTUSHo, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?TIMONO, Apemantus, you are welcome.APEMANTUSNo;You shall not make me welcome:I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.TIMONFie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour thereDoes not become a man: 'tis much to blame.They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yondman is ever angry. Go, let him have a table byhimself, for he does neither affect company, nor ishe fit for't, indeed.APEMANTUSLet me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come toobserve; I give thee warning on't.TIMONI take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;prithee, let my meat make thee silent.APEMANTUSI scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I shouldne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number ofmen eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves meto see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:Methinks they should invite them without knives;Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.There's much example for't; the fellow that sitsnext him now, parts bread with him, pledges thebreath of him in a divided draught, is the readiestman to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were ahuge man, I should fear to drink at meals;Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:Great men should drink with harness on their throats.TIMONMy lord, in heart; and let the health go round.Second LordLet it flow this way, my good lord.APEMANTUSFlow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tideswell. Those healths will make thee and thy statelook ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak tobe a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:This and my food are equals; there's no odds:Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.Apemantus' grace.Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;I pray for no man but myself:Grant I may never prove so fond,To trust man on his oath or bond;Or a harlot, for her weeping;Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:Or a keeper with my freedom;Or my friends, if I should need 'em.Amen. So fall to't:Rich men sin, and I eat root.Eats and drinksMuch good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!TIMONCaptain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.ALCIBIADESMy heart is ever at your service, my lord.TIMONYou had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than adinner of friends.ALCIBIADESSo the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meatlike 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.APEMANTUSWould all those fatterers were thine enemies then,that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!First LordMight we but have that happiness, my lord, that youwould once use our hearts, whereby we might expresssome part of our zeals, we should think ourselvesfor ever perfect.TIMONO, no doubt, my good friends, but the godsthemselves have provided that I shall have much helpfrom you: how had you been my friends else? whyhave you that charitable title from thousands, didnot you chiefly belong to my heart? I have toldmore of you to myself than you can with modestyspeak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirmyou. O you gods, think I, what need we have anyfriends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? theywere the most needless creatures living, should wene'er have use for 'em, and would most resemblesweet instruments hung up in cases that keep theirsounds to themselves. Why, I have often wishedmyself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. Weare born to do benefits: and what better orproperer can we can our own than the riches of ourfriends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to haveso many, like brothers, commanding one another'sfortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: toforget their faults, I drink to you.APEMANTUSThou weepest to make them drink, Timon.Second LordJoy had the like conception in our eyesAnd at that instant like a babe sprung up.APEMANTUSHo, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.Third LordI promise you, my lord, you moved me much.APEMANTUSMuch!Tucket, withinTIMONWhat means that trump?Enter a ServantHow now?ServantPlease you, my lord, there are certainladies most desirous of admittance.TIMONLadies! what are their wills?ServantThere comes with them a forerunner, my lord, whichbears that office, to signify their pleasures.TIMONI pray, let them be admitted.Enter CupidCupidHail to thee, worthy Timon, and to allThat of his bounties taste! The five best sensesAcknowledge thee their patron; and come freelyTo gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;They only now come but to feast thine eyes.TIMONThey're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:Music, make their welcome!Exit CupidFirst LordYou see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playingAPEMANTUSHoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!They dance! they are mad women.Like madness is the glory of this life.As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;And spend our flatteries, to drink those menUpon whose age we void it up again,With poisonous spite and envy.Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their gravesOf their friends' gift?I should fear those that dance before me nowWould one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;Men shut their doors against a setting sun.The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of  TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an  Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and ceaseTIMONYou have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,Which was not half so beautiful and kind;You have added worth unto 't and lustre,And entertain'd me with mine own device;I am to thank you for 't.First LadyMy lord, you take us even at the best.APEMANTUS'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not holdtaking, I doubt me.TIMONLadies, there is an idle banquet attends you:Please you to dispose yourselves.All LadiesMost thankfully, my lord.Exeunt Cupid and LadiesTIMONFlavius.FLAVIUSMy lord?TIMONThe little casket bring me hither.FLAVIUSYes, my lord. More jewels yet!There is no crossing him in 's humour;AsideElse I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.ExitFirst LordWhere be our men?ServantHere, my lord, in readiness.Second LordOur horses!Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casketTIMONO my friends,I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,I must entreat you, honour me so muchAs to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,Kind my lord.First LordI am so far already in your gifts,--AllSo are we all.Enter a ServantServantMy lord, there are certain nobles of the senateNewly alighted, and come to visit you.TIMONThey are fairly welcome.FLAVIUSI beseech your honour,Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.TIMONNear! why then, another time I'll hear thee:I prithee, let's be provided to show thementertainment.FLAVIUS[Aside]  I scarce know how.Enter a Second ServantSecond ServantMay it please your honour, Lord Lucius,Out of his free love, hath presented to youFour milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.TIMONI shall accept them fairly; let the presentsBe worthily entertain'd.Enter a third ServantHow now! what news?Third ServantPlease you, my lord, that honourablegentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your companyto-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honourtwo brace of greyhounds.TIMONI'll hunt with him; and let them be received,Not without fair reward.FLAVIUS[Aside]                What will this come to?He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,And all out of an empty coffer:Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,To show him what a beggar his heart is,Being of no power to make his wishes good:His promises fly so beyond his stateThat what he speaks is all in debt; he owesFor every word: he is so kind that he nowPays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.Well, would I were gently put out of officeBefore I were forced out!Happier is he that has no friend to feedThan such that do e'en enemies exceed.I bleed inwardly for my lord.ExitTIMONYou do yourselvesMuch wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.Second LordWith more than common thanks I will receive it.Third LordO, he's the very soul of bounty!TIMONAnd now I remember, my lord, you gaveGood words the other day of a bay courserI rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.Second LordO, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.TIMONYou may take my word, my lord; I know, no manCan justly praise but what he does affect:I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.All LordsO, none so welcome.TIMONI take all and your several visitationsSo kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;It comes in charity to thee: for all thy livingIs 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hastLie in a pitch'd field.ALCIBIADESAy, defiled land, my lord.First LordWe are so virtuously bound--TIMONAnd soAm I to you.Second LordSo infinitely endear'd--TIMONAll to you.

Friendship's full of dregs:Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.TIMONNow, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would begood to thee.APEMANTUSNo, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,there would be none left to rail upon thee, and thenthou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself inpaper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps andvain-glories?TIMONNay, an you begin to rail on society once, I amsworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and comewith better music.ExitAPEMANTUSSo:Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:I'll lock thy heaven from thee.O, that men's ears should beTo counsel deaf, but not to flattery!ExitACT IISCENE I.

It cannot hold; it will not.If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty moreBetter than he, why, give my horse to Timon,Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,And able horses. No porter at his gate,But rather one that smiles and still invitesAll that pass by. It cannot hold: no reasonCan found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!Caphis, I say!Enter CAPHISCAPHISHere, sir; what is your pleasure?SenatorGet on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;Importune him for my moneys; be not ceasedWith slight denial, nor then silenced when--'Commend me to your master'--and the capPlays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,My uses cry to me, I must serve my turnOut of mine own; his days and times are pastAnd my reliances on his fracted datesHave smit my credit: I love and honour him,But must not break my back to heal his finger;Immediate are my needs, and my reliefMust not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,But find supply immediate. Get you gone:Put on a most importunate aspect,A visage of demand; for, I do fear,When every feather sticks in his own wing,Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.CAPHISI go, sir.Senator'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,And have the dates in contempt.CAPHISI will, sir.SenatorGo.ExeuntSCENE II. The same.

When men cometo borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, andgo away merry; but they enter my mistress' housemerrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?Varro's Servant	I could render one.APEMANTUSDo it then, that we may account thee a whoremasterand a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt beno less esteemed.Varro's Servant	What is a whoremaster, fool?FoolA fool in good clothes, and something like thee.'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,with two stones moe than's artificial one: he isvery often like a knight; and, generally, in allshapes that man goes up and down in from fourscoreto thirteen, this spirit walks in.Varro's Servant	Thou art not altogether a fool.FoolNor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery asI have, so much wit thou lackest.APEMANTUSThat answer might have become Apemantus.All ServantsAside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUSAPEMANTUSCome with me, fool, come.FoolI do not always follow lover, elder brother andwoman; sometime the philosopher.Exeunt APEMANTUS and FoolFLAVIUSPray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.Exeunt ServantsTIMONYou make me marvel: wherefore ere this timeHad you not fully laid my state before me,That I might so have rated my expense,As I had leave of means?FLAVIUSYou would not hear me,At many leisures I proposed.TIMONGo to:Perchance some single vantages you took.When my indispos ition put you back:And that unaptness made your minister,Thus to excuse yourself.FLAVIUSO my good lord,At many times I brought in my accounts,Laid them before you; you would throw them off,And say, you found them in mine honesty.When, for some trifling present, you have bid meReturn so much, I have shook my head and wept;Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd youTo hold your hand more close: I did endureNot seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I havePrompted you in the ebb of your estateAnd your great flow of debts. My loved lord,Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--The greatest of your having lacks a halfTo pay your present debts.TIMONLet all my land be sold.FLAVIUS'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;And what remains will hardly stop the mouthOf present dues: the future comes apace:What shall defend the interim? and at lengthHow goes our reckoning?TIMONTo Lacedaemon did my land extend.FLAVIUSO my good lord, the world is but a word:Were it all yours to give it in a breath,How quickly were it gone!TIMONYou tell me true.FLAVIUSIf you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,Call me before the exactest auditorsAnd set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,When all our offices have been oppress'dWith riotous feeders, when our vaults have weptWith drunken spilth of wine, when every roomHath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,I have retired me to a wasteful cock,And set mine eyes at flow.TIMONPrithee, no more.FLAVIUSHeavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasantsThis night englutted! Who is not Timon's?What heart, head, sword, force, means, but isLord Timon's?Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,These flies are couch'd.TIMONCome, sermon me no further:No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;If I would broach the vessels of my love,And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,Men and men's fortunes could I frankly useAs I can bid thee speak.FLAVIUSAssurance bless your thoughts!TIMONAnd, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,That I account them blessings; for by theseShall I try friends: you shall perceive how youMistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other ServantsServantsMy lord? my lord?TIMONI will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honourto-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to theirloves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions havefound time to use 'em toward a supply of money: letthe request be fifty talents.FLAMINIUSAs you have said, my lord.FLAVIUS[Aside]  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!TIMONGo you, sir, to the senators--Of whom, even to the state's best health, I haveDeserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instantA thousand talents to me.FLAVIUSI have been bold--For that I knew it the most general way--To them to use your signet and your name;But they do shake their heads, and I am hereNo richer in return.TIMONIs't true? can't be?FLAVIUSThey answer, in a joint and corporate voice,That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannotDo what they would; are sorry--you are honourable,--But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--Something hath been amiss--a noble natureMay catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--And so, intending other serious matters,After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,With certain half-caps and cold-moving nodsThey froze me into silence.TIMONYou gods, reward them!Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellowsHave their ingratitude in them hereditary:Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;And nature, as it grows again toward earth,Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.To a ServantGo to Ventidius.To FLAVIUSPrithee, be not sad,Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.No blame belongs to thee.To ServantVentidius latelyBuried his father; by whose death he's stepp'dInto a great estate: when he was poor,Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;Bid him suppose some good necessityTouches his friend, which craves to be remember'dWith those five talents.Exit ServantTo FLAVIUSThat had, give't these fellowsTo whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.FLAVIUSI would I could not think it: that thought isbounty's foe;Being free itself, it thinks all others so.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. A room in Lucullus' house.FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to himServantI have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.FLAMINIUSI thank you, sir.Enter LUCULLUSServantHere's my lord.LUCULLUS[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, Iwarrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silverbasin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honestFlaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.Fill me some wine.Exit ServantsAnd how does that honourable, complete, free-heartedgentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lordand master?FLAMINIUSHis health is well sir.LUCULLUSI am right glad that his health is well, sir: andwhat hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?FLAMINIUS'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in mylord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour tosupply; who, having great and instant occasion touse fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship tofurnish him, nothing doubting your presentassistance therein.LUCULLUSLa, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would notkeep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'dined with him, and told him on't, and come again tosupper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warningby my coming. Every man has his fault, and honestyis his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er gethim from't.Re-enter Servant, with wineServantPlease your lordship, here is the wine.LUCULLUSFlaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.FLAMINIUSYour lordship speaks your pleasure.LUCULLUSI have observed thee always for a towardly promptspirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows whatbelongs to reason; and canst use the time well, ifthe time use thee well: good parts in thee.To ServantGet you gone, sirrah.Exit ServantDraw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's abountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thouknowest well enough, although thou comest to me,that this is no time to lend money, especially uponbare friendship, without security. Here's threesolidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and saythou sawest me not. Fare thee well.FLAMINIUSIs't possible the world should so much differ,And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,To him that worships thee!Throwing the money backLUCULLUSHa! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.ExitFLAMINIUSMay these add to the number that may scald thee!Let moulten coin be thy damnation,Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,I feel master's passion! this slave,Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,When he is turn'd to poison?O, may diseases only work upon't!And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of natureWhich my lord paid for, be of any powerTo expel sickness, but prolong his hour!ExitSCENE II. A public place.Enter LUCILIUS, with three StrangersLUCILIUSWho, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, andan honourable gentleman.First StrangerWe know him for no less, though we are but strangersto him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, andwhich I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon'shappy hours are done and past, and his estateshrinks from him.LUCILIUSFie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.Second StrangerBut believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrowso many talents, nay, urged extremely for't andshowed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.LUCILIUSHow!Second StrangerI tell you, denied, my lord.LUCILIUSWhat a strange case was that! now, before the gods,I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!there was very little honour showed in't. For my ownpart, I must needs confess, I have received somesmall kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewelsand such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I shouldne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.Enter SERVILIUSSERVILIUSSee, by good hap, yonder's my lord;I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--To LUCIUSLUCILIUSServilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my veryexquisite friend.SERVILIUSMay it please your honour, my lord hath sent--LUCILIUSHa! what has he sent? I am so much endeared tothat lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thankhim, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?SERVILIUSHas only sent his present occasion now, my lord;requesting your lordship to supply his instant usewith so many talents.LUCILIUSI know his lordship is but merry with me;He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.SERVILIUSBut in the mean time he wants less, my lord.If his occasion were not virtuous,I should not urge it half so faithfully.LUCILIUSDost thou speak seriously, Servilius?SERVILIUSUpon my soul,'tis true, sir.LUCILIUSWhat a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myselfagainst such a good time, when I might ha' shownmyself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that Ishould purchase the day before for a little part,and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,before the gods, I am not able to do,--the morebeast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timonmyself, these gentlemen can witness! but I wouldnot, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and Ihope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,because I have no power to be kind: and tell himthis from me, I count it one of my greatestafflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such anhonourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will youbefriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?SERVILIUSYes, sir, I shall.LUCILIUSI'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.Exit SERVILIUSTrue as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;And he that's once denied will hardly speed.ExitFirst StrangerDo you observe this, Hostilius?Second StrangerAy, too well.First StrangerWhy, this is the world's soul; and just of thesame pieceIs every flatterer's spirit. Who can call himHis friend that dips in the same dish? for, inMy knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,And kept his credit with his purse,Supported his estate; nay, Timon's moneyHas paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;And yet--O, see the monstrousness of manWhen he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--He does deny him, in respect of his,What charitable men afford to beggars.Third StrangerReligion groans at it.First StrangerFor mine own part,I never tasted Timon in my life,Nor came any of his bounties over me,To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,For his right noble mind, illustrious virtueAnd honourable carriage,Had his necessity made use of me,I would have put my wealth into donation,And the best half should have return'd to him,So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,Men must learn now with pity to dispense;For policy sits above conscience.ExeuntSCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON'sSEMPRONIUSMust he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'boveall others?He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;And now Ventidius is wealthy too,Whom he redeem'd from prison: all theseOwe their estates unto him.ServantMy lord,They have all been touch'd and found base metal, forThey have au denied him.SEMPRONIUSHow! have they denied him?Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?And does he send to me? Three? hum!It shows but little love or judgment in him:Must I be his last refuge! His friends, likephysicians,Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,But his occasion might have woo'd me first;For, in my conscience, I was the first manThat e'er received gift from him:And does he think so backwardly of me now,That I'll requite its last? No:So it may prove an argument of laughterTo the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,And with their faint reply this answer join;Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.ExitServantExcellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. Thedevil knew not what he did when he made manpolitic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannotthink but, in the end, the villainies of man willset him clear. How fairly this lord strives toappear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,like those that under hot ardent zeal would setwhole realms on fire: Of such a nature is hispolitic love.This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wardsMany a bounteous year must be employ'dNow to guard sure their master.And this is all a liberal course allows;Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.ExitSCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of  LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming outVarro'sFirst ServantWell met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.TITUSThe like to you kind Varro.HORTENSIUSLucius!What, do we meet together?Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I thinkOne business does command us all; for mine Is money.TITUSSo is theirs and ours.Enter PHILOTUSLucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!PHILOTUSGood day at once.Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother.What do you think the hour?PHILOTUSLabouring for nine.Lucilius' Servant	So much?PHILOTUSIs not my lord seen yet?Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.PHILOTUSI wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:You must consider that a prodigal courseIs like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;That is one may reach deep enough, and yetFind little.PHILOTUSI am of your fear for that.TITUSI'll show you how to observe a strange event.Your lord sends now for money.HORTENSIUSMost true, he does.TITUSAnd he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,For which I wait for money.HORTENSIUSIt is against my heart.Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,Timon in this should pay more than he owes:And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,And send for money for 'em.HORTENSIUSI'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.Varro'sFirst ServantYes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.Varro'sFirst Servant'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,Your master's confidence was above mine;Else, surely, his had equall'd.Enter FLAMINIUS.TITUSOne of Lord Timon's men.Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready tocome forth?FLAMINIUSNo, indeed, he is not.TITUSWe attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.FLAMINIUSI need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.ExitEnter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffledLucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.TITUSDo you hear, sir?Varro'sSecond ServantBy your leave, sir,--FLAVIUSWhat do ye ask of me, my friend?TITUSWe wait for certain money here, sir.FLAVIUSAy,If money were as certain as your waiting,'Twere sure enough.Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?Then they could smile and fawn upon his debtsAnd take down the interest into theirgluttonous maws.You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;Let me pass quietly:Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;I have no more to reckon, he to spend.Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve.FLAVIUSIf 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;For you serve knaves.ExitVarro'sFirst ServantHow! what does his cashiered worship mutter?Varro'sSecond ServantNo matter what; he's poor, and that's revengeenough. Who can speak broader than he that has nohouse to put his head in? such may rail againstgreat buildings.Enter SERVILIUSTITUSO, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.SERVILIUSIf I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair someother hour, I should derive much from't; for,take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously todiscontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:And, if it be so far beyond his health,Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,And make a clear way to the gods.SERVILIUSGood gods!TITUSWe cannot take this for answer, sir.FLAMINIUS[Within]  Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS followingTIMONWhat, are my doors opposed against my passage?Have I been ever free, and must my houseBe my retentive enemy, my gaol?The place which I have feasted, does it now,Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus.TITUSMy lord, here is my bill.Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.HORTENSIUSAnd mine, my lord.BothVarro's Servants	And ours, my lord.PHILOTUSAll our bills.TIMONKnock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-TIMONCut my heart in sums.TITUSMine, fifty talents.TIMONTell out my blood.Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord.TIMONFive thousand drops pays that.What yours?--and yours?Varro'sFirst ServantMy lord,--Varro'sSecond ServantMy lord,--TIMONTear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!ExitHORTENSIUS'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their capsat their money: these debts may well be calleddesperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.ExeuntRe-enter TIMON and FLAVIUSTIMONThey have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.Creditors? devils!FLAVIUSMy dear lord,--TIMONWhat if it should be so?FLAVIUSMy lord,--TIMONI'll have it so. My steward!FLAVIUSHere, my lord.TIMONSo fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:All, sirrah, all:I'll once more feast the rascals.FLAVIUSO my lord,You only speak from your distracted soul;There is not so much left, to furnish outA moderate table.TIMONBe't not in thy care; go,I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tideOf knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.ExeuntSCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.First SenatorMy lord, you have my voice to it; the fault'sBloody; 'tis necessary he should die:Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.Second SenatorMost true; the law shall bruise him.Enter ALCIBIADES, with AttendantsALCIBIADESHonour, health, and compassion to the senate!First SenatorNow, captain?ALCIBIADESI am an humble suitor to your virtues;For pity is the virtue of the law,And none but tyrants use it cruelly.It pleases time and fortune to lie heavyUpon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depthTo those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.He is a man, setting his fate aside,Of comely virtues:Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--An honour in him which buys out his fault--But with a noble fury and fair spirit,Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,He did oppose his foe:And with such sober and unnoted passionHe did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,As if he had but proved an argument.First SenatorYou undergo too strict a paradox,Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:Your words have took such pains as if they labour'dTo bring manslaughter into form and set quarrellingUpon the head of valour; which indeedIs valour misbegot and came into the worldWhen sects and factions were newly born:He's truly valiant that can wisely sufferThe worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongsHis outsides, to wear them like his raiment,carelessly,And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,To bring it into danger.If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!ALCIBIADESMy lord,--First SenatorYou cannot make gross sins look clear:To revenge is no valour, but to bear.ALCIBIADESMy lords, then, under favour, pardon me,If I speak like a captain.Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,And let the foes quietly cut their throats,Without repugnancy? If there beSuch valour in the bearing, what make weAbroad? why then, women are more valiantThat stay at home, if bearing carry it,And the ass more captain than the lion, the felonLoaden with irons wiser than the judge,If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,As you are great, be pitifully good:Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.To be in anger is impiety;But who is man that is not angry?Weigh but the crime with this.Second SenatorYou breathe in vain.ALCIBIADESIn vain! his service doneAt Lacedaemon and ByzantiumWere a sufficient briber for his life.First SenatorWhat's that?ALCIBIADESI say, my lords, he has done fair service,And slain in fight many of your enemies:How full of valour did he bear himselfIn the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!Second SenatorHe has made too much plenty with 'em;He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that oftenDrowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:If there were no foes, that were enoughTo overcome him: in that beastly furyHe has been known to commit outrages,And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,His days are foul and his drink dangerous.First SenatorHe dies.ALCIBIADESHard fate! he might have died in war.My lords, if not for any parts in him--Though his right arm might purchase his own timeAnd be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:And, for I know your reverend ages loveSecurity, I'll pawn my victories, allMy honours to you, upon his good returns.If by this crime he owes the law his life,Why, let the war receive 't in valiant goreFor law is strict, and war is nothing more.First SenatorWe are for law: he dies; urge it no more,On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,He forfeits his own blood that spills another.ALCIBIADESMust it be so? it must not be. My lords,I do beseech you, know me.Second SenatorHow!ALCIBIADESCall me to your remembrances.Third SenatorWhat!ALCIBIADESI cannot think but your age has forgot me;It could not else be, I should prove so base,To sue, and be denied such common grace:My wounds ache at you.First SenatorDo you dare our anger?'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;We banish thee for ever.ALCIBIADESBanish me!Banish your dotage; banish usury,That makes the senate ugly.First SenatorIf, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swellour spirit,He shall be executed presently.Exeunt SenatorsALCIBIADESNow the gods keep you old enough; that you may liveOnly in bone, that none may look on you!I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,While they have told their money and let outTheir coin upon large interest, I myselfRich only in large hurts. All those for this?Is this the balsam that the usuring senatePours into captains' wounds? Banishment!It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer upMy discontented troops, and lay for hearts.'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.ExitSCENE VI. The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.  Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at several doorsFirst LordThe good time of day to you, sir.Second LordI also wish it to you. I think this honourable lorddid but try us this other day.First LordUpon that were my thoughts tiring, when weencountered: I hope it is not so low with him ashe made it seem in the trial of his several friends.Second LordIt should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.First LordI should think so: he hath sent me an earnestinviting, which many my near occasions did urge meto put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, andI must needs appear.Second LordIn like manner was I in debt to my importunatebusiness, but he would not hear my excuse. I amsorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that myprovision was out.First LordI am sick of that grief too, as I understand how allthings go.Second LordEvery man here's so. What would he have borrowed ofyou?First LordA thousand pieces.Second LordA thousand pieces!First LordWhat of you?Second LordHe sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.Enter TIMON and AttendantsTIMONWith all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?First LordEver at the best, hearing well of your lordship.Second LordThe swallow follows not summer more willing than weyour lordship.TIMON[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; suchsummer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will notrecompense this long stay: feast your ears with themusic awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' thetrumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.First LordI hope it remains not unkindly with your lordshipthat I returned you an empty messenger.TIMONO, sir, let it not trouble you.Second LordMy noble lord,--TIMONAh, my good friend, what cheer?Second LordMy most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,I was so unfortunate a beggar.TIMONThink not on 't, sir.Second LordIf you had sent but two hours before,--TIMONLet it not cumber your better remembrance.The banquet brought inCome, bring in all together.Second LordAll covered dishes!First LordRoyal cheer, I warrant you.Third LordDoubt not that, if money and the season can yieldit.First LordHow do you? What's the news?Third LordAlcibiades is banished: hear you of it?First LordSecond LordAlcibiades banished!Third Lord'Tis so, be sure of it.First LordHow! how!Second LordI pray you, upon what?TIMONMy worthy friends, will you draw near?Third LordI'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.Second LordThis is the old man still.Third LordWill 't hold? will 't hold?Second LordIt does: but time will--and so--Third LordI do conceive.TIMONEach man to his stool, with that spur as he would tothe lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in allplaces alike. Make not a city feast of it, to letthe meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.You great benefactors, sprinkle our society withthankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselvespraised: but reserve still to give, lest yourdeities be despised. Lend to each man enough, thatone need not lend to another; for, were yourgodheads to borrow of men, men would forsake thegods. Make the meat be beloved more than the manthat gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be withouta score of villains: if there sit twelve women atthe table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. Therest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,together with the common lag of people--what isamiss in them, you gods, make suitable fordestruction. For these my present friends, as theyare to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and tonothing are they welcome.Uncover, dogs, and lap.The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm waterSome SpeakWhat does his lordship mean?Some OthersI know not.TIMONMay you a better feast never behold,You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm waterIs your perfection. This is Timon's last;Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,Washes it off, and sprinkles in your facesYour reeking villany.Throwing the water in their facesLive loathed and long,Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!Of man and beast the infinite maladyCrust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.Throws the dishes at them, and drives them outWhat, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated beOf Timon man and all humanity!ExitRe-enter the Lords, Senators,  & cFirst LordHow now, my lords!Second LordKnow you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?Third LordPush! did you see my cap?Fourth LordI have lost my gown.First LordHe's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he hasbeat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?Third LordDid you see my cap?Second LordHere 'tis.Fourth LordHere lies my gown.First LordLet's make no stay.Second LordLord Timon's mad.Third LordI feel 't upon my bones.Fourth LordOne day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. Without the walls of Athens.Enter TIMONTIMONLet me look back upon thee. O thou wall,That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,And minister in their steads! to general filthsConvert o' the instant, green virginity,Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;Rather than render back, out with your knives,And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,Decline to your confounding contraries,And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,Your potent and infectious fevers heapOn Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,Cripple our senators, that their limbs may haltAs lamely as their manners. Lust and libertyCreep in the minds and marrows of our youth,That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their cropBe general leprosy! Breath infect breath,at their society, as their friendship, maymerely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,But nakedness, thou detestable town!Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!Timon will to the woods; where he shall findThe unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--The Athenians both within and out that wall!And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may growTo the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.ExitSCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three ServantsFirst ServantHear you, master steward, where's our master?Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?FLAVIUSAlack, my fellows, what should I say to you?Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,I am as poor as you.First ServantSuch a house broke!So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and notOne friend to take his fortune by the arm,And go along with him!Second ServantAs we do turn our backsFrom our companion thrown into his grave,So his familiars to his buried fortunesSlink all away, leave their false vows with him,Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,A dedicated beggar to the air,With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.Enter other ServantsFLAVIUSAll broken implements of a ruin'd house.Third ServantYet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,Hearing the surges threat: we must all partInto this sea of air.FLAVIUSGood fellows all,The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.Servants embrace, and part several waysO, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,Since riches point to misery and contempt?Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to liveBut in a dream of friendship?To have his pomp and all what state compoundsBut only painted, like his varnish'd friends?Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunesAre made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seatOf monstrous friends, nor has he with him toSupply his life, or that which can command it.I'll follow and inquire him out:I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.ExitSCENE III. Woods and cave, near the seashore.Enter TIMON, from the caveO blessed breeding sun, draw from the earthRotten humidity; below thy sister's orbInfect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,Whose procreation, residence, and birth,Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,But by contempt of nature.Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,The beggar native honour.It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,In purity of manhood stand upright,And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,So are they all; for every grise of fortuneIs smooth'd by that below: the learned pateDucks to the golden fool: all is oblique;There's nothing level in our cursed natures,But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'dAll feasts, societies, and throngs of men!His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!DiggingWho seeks for better of thee, sauce his palateWith thy most operant poison! What is here?Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, thisWill lug your priests and servants from your sides,Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:This yellow slaveWill knit and break religions, bless the accursed,Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thievesAnd give them title, knee and approbationWith senators on the bench: this is itThat makes the wappen'd widow wed again;She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous soresWould cast the gorge at, this embalms and spicesTo the April day again. Come, damned earth,Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st oddsAmong the route of nations, I will make theeDo thy right nature.March afar offHa! a drum ? Thou'rt quick,But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.Nay, stay thou out for earnest.Keeping some goldEnter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRAALCIBIADESWhat art thou there? speak.TIMONA beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,For showing me again the eyes of man!ALCIBIADESWhat is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,That art thyself a man?TIMONI am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,That I might love thee something.ALCIBIADESI know thee well;But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.TIMONI know thee too; and more than that I know thee,I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;Then what should war be? This fell whore of thineHath in her more destruction than thy sword,For all her cherubim look.PHRYNIAThy lips rot off!TIMONI will not kiss thee; then the rot returnsTo thine own lips again.ALCIBIADESHow came the noble Timon to this change?TIMONAs the moon does, by wanting light to give:But then renew I could not, like the moon;There were no suns to borrow of.ALCIBIADESNoble Timon,What friendship may I do thee?TIMONNone, but toMaintain my opinion.ALCIBIADESWhat is it, Timon?TIMONPromise me friendship, but perform none: if thouwilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou arta man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, forthou art a man!ALCIBIADESI have heard in some sort of thy miseries.TIMONThou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.ALCIBIADESI see them now; then was a blessed time.TIMONAs thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.TIMANDRAIs this the Athenian minion, whom the worldVoiced so regardfully?TIMONArt thou Timandra?TIMANDRAYes.TIMONBe a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.Make use of thy salt hours: season the slavesFor tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youthTo the tub-fast and the diet.TIMANDRAHang thee, monster!ALCIBIADESPardon him, sweet Timandra; for his witsAre drown'd and lost in his calamities.I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,The want whereof doth daily make revoltIn my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--TIMONI prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.ALCIBIADESI am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.TIMONHow dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?I had rather be alone.ALCIBIADESWhy, fare thee well:Here is some gold for thee.TIMONKeep it, I cannot eat it.ALCIBIADESWhen I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--TIMONWarr'st thou 'gainst Athens?ALCIBIADESAy, Timon, and have cause.TIMONThe gods confound them all in thy conquest;And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!ALCIBIADESWhy me, Timon?TIMONThat, by killing of villains,Thou wast born to conquer my country.Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;Be as a planetary plague, when JoveWill o'er some high-viced city hang his poisonIn the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;It is her habit only that is honest,Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheekMake soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,Are not within the leaf of pity writ,But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;Think it a bastard, whom the oracleHath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.ALCIBIADESHast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thougivest me,Not all thy counsel.TIMONDost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curseupon thee!PHRYNIATIMANDRAGive us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?TIMONEnough to make a whore forswear her trade,And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swearInto strong shudders and to heavenly aguesThe immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;Let your close fire predominate his smoke,And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofsWith burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,A pox of wrinkles!PHRYNIATIMANDRAWell, more gold: what then?Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.TIMONConsumptions sowIn hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,That he may never more false title plead,Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,That scolds against the quality of flesh,And not believes himself: down with the nose,Down with it flat; take the bridge quite awayOf him that, his particular to foresee,Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pateruffians bald;And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the warDerive some pain from you: plague all;That your activity may defeat and quellThe source of all erection. There's more gold:Do you damn others, and let this damn you,And ditches grave you all!PHRYNIATIMANDRAMore counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.TIMONMore whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.ALCIBIADESStrike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.TIMONIf I hope well, I'll never see thee more.ALCIBIADESI never did thee harm.TIMONYes, thou spokest well of me.ALCIBIADESCall'st thou that harm?TIMONMen daily find it. Get thee away, and takeThy beagles with thee.ALCIBIADESWe but offend him. Strike!Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA, and TIMANDRATIMONThat nature, being sick of man's unkindness,Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,DiggingWhose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,Engenders the black toad and adder blue,The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,With all the abhorred births below crisp heavenWhereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward faceHath to the marbled mansion all aboveNever presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughtsAnd morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,That from it all consideration slips!Enter APEMANTUSMore man? plague, plague!APEMANTUSI was directed hither: men reportThou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.TIMON'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!APEMANTUSThis is in thee a nature but infected;A poor unmanly melancholy sprungFrom change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgotThat ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,By putting on the cunning of a carper.Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thriveBy that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcomeTo knaves and all approachers: 'tis most justThat thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.TIMONWere I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.APEMANTUSThou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'stThat the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,And skip where thou point'st out? will thecold brook,Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creaturesWhose naked natures live in an the spiteOf wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,To the conflicting elements exposed,Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;O, thou shalt find--TIMONA fool of thee: depart.APEMANTUSI love thee better now than e'er I did.TIMONI hate thee worse.APEMANTUSWhy?TIMONThou flatter'st misery.APEMANTUSI flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.TIMONWhy dost thou seek me out?APEMANTUSTo vex thee.TIMONAlways a villain's office or a fool's.Dost please thyself in't?APEMANTUSAy.TIMONWhat! a knave too?APEMANTUSIf thou didst put this sour-cold habit onTo castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thouDost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,Wert thou not beggar. Willing miseryOutlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:The one is filling still, never complete;The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,Hath a distracted and most wretched being,Worse than the worst, content.Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.TIMONNot by his breath that is more miserable.Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender armWith favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceededThe sweet degrees that this brief world affordsTo such as may the passive drugs of itFreely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyselfIn general riot; melted down thy youthIn different beds of lust; and never learn'dThe icy precepts of respect, but follow'dThe sugar'd game before thee. But myself,Who had the world as my confectionary,The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of menAt duty, more than I could frame employment,That numberless upon me stuck as leavesDo on the oak, hive with one winter's brushFell from their boughs and left me open, bareFor every storm that blows: I, to bear this,That never knew but better, is some burden:Thy nature did commence in sufferance, timeHath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuffTo some she beggar and compounded theePoor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.APEMANTUSArt thou proud yet?TIMONAy, that I am not thee.APEMANTUSI, that I wasNo prodigal.TIMONI, that I am one now:Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.That the whole life of Athens were in this!Thus would I eat it.Eating a rootAPEMANTUSHere; I will mend thy feast.Offering him a rootTIMONFirst mend my company, take away thyself.APEMANTUSSo I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.TIMON'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;if not, I would it were.APEMANTUSWhat wouldst thou have to Athens?TIMONThee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.APEMANTUSHere is no use for gold.TIMONThe best and truest;For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.APEMANTUSWhere liest o' nights, Timon?TIMONUnder that's above me.Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?APEMANTUSWhere my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eatit.TIMONWould poison were obedient and knew my mind!APEMANTUSWhere wouldst thou send it?TIMONTo sauce thy dishes.APEMANTUSThe middle of humanity thou never knewest, but theextremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy giltand thy perfume, they mocked thee for too muchcuriosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but artdespised for the contrary. There's a medlar forthee, eat it.TIMONOn what I hate I feed not.APEMANTUSDost hate a medlar?TIMONAy, though it look like thee.APEMANTUSAn thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldsthave loved thyself better now. What man didst thouever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?TIMONWho, without those means thou talkest of, didst thouever know beloved?APEMANTUSMyself.TIMONI understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep adog.APEMANTUSWhat things in the world canst thou nearest compareto thy flatterers?TIMONWomen nearest; but men, men are the thingsthemselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?APEMANTUSGive it the beasts, to be rid of the men.TIMONWouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion ofmen, and remain a beast with the beasts?APEMANTUSAy, Timon.TIMONA beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox wouldbeguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox wouldeat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion wouldsuspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused bythe ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness wouldtorment thee, and still thou livedst but as abreakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thygreediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldsthazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou theunicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee andmake thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wertthou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by theleopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german tothe lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors onthy life: all thy safety were remotion and thydefence absence. What beast couldst thou be, thatwere not subject to a beast? and what a beast artthou already, that seest not thy loss intransformation!APEMANTUSIf thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thoumightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth ofAthens is become a forest of beasts.TIMONHow has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?APEMANTUSYonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague ofcompany light upon thee! I will fear to catch itand give way: when I know not what else to do, I'llsee thee again.TIMONWhen there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt bewelcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.APEMANTUSThou art the cap of all the fools alive.TIMONWould thou wert clean enough to spit upon!APEMANTUSA plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.TIMONAll villains that do stand by thee are pure.APEMANTUSThere is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.TIMONIf I name thee.I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.APEMANTUSI would my tongue could rot them off!TIMONAway, thou issue of a mangy dog!Choler does kill me that thou art alive;I swound to see thee.APEMANTUSWould thou wouldst burst!TIMONAway,Thou tedious rogue!

O thou touch of hearts!Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtueSet them into confounding odds, that beastsMay have the world in empire!APEMANTUSWould 'twere so!But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.TIMONThrong'd to!APEMANTUSAy.TIMONThy back, I prithee.APEMANTUSLive, and love thy misery.TIMONLong live so, and so die.Exit APEMANTUSI am quit.Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.Enter BandittiFirst BanditWhere should he have this gold? It is some poorfragment, some slender sort of his remainder: themere want of gold, and the falling-from of hisfriends, drove him into this melancholy.Second BanditIt is noised he hath a mass of treasure.Third BanditLet us make the assay upon him: if he care notfor't, he will supply us easily; if he covetouslyreserve it, how shall's get it?Second BanditTrue; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.First BanditIs not this he?BandittiWhere?Second Bandit'Tis his description.Third BanditHe; I know him.BandittiSave thee, Timon.TIMONNow, thieves?BandittiSoldiers, not thieves.TIMONBoth too; and women's sons.BandittiWe are not thieves, but men that much do want.TIMONYour greatest want is, you want much of meat.Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bushLays her full mess before you. Want! why want?First BanditWe cannot live on grass, on berries, water,As beasts and birds and fishes.TIMONNor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you conThat you are thieves profess'd, that you work notIn holier shapes: for there is boundless theftIn limited professions. Rascal thieves,Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;His antidotes are poison, and he slaysMoe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.The sun's a thief, and with his great attractionRobs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolvesThe moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,That feeds and breeds by a composture stolenFrom general excrement: each thing's a thief:The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough powerHave uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,Break open shops; nothing can you steal,But thieves do lose it: steal no less for thisI give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.Third BanditHas almost charmed me from my profession, bypersuading me to it.First Bandit'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advisesus; not to have us thrive in our mystery.Second BanditI'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.First BanditLet us first see peace in Athens: there is no timeso miserable but a man may be true.Exeunt BandittiEnter FLAVIUSFLAVIUSO you gods!Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?Full of decay and failing? O monumentAnd wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!What an alteration of honourHas desperate want made!What viler thing upon the earth than friendsWho can bring noblest minds to basest ends!How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,When man was wish'd to love his enemies!Grant I may ever love, and rather wooThose that would mischief me than those that do!Has caught me in his eye: I will presentMy honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!TIMONAway! what art thou?FLAVIUSHave you forgot me, sir?TIMONWhy dost ask that? I have forgot all men;Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.FLAVIUSAn honest poor servant of yours.TIMONThen I know thee not:I never had honest man about me, I; allI kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.FLAVIUSThe gods are witness,Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer griefFor his undone lord than mine eyes for you.TIMONWhat, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then Ilove thee,Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'stFlinty mankind; whose eyes do never giveBut thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!FLAVIUSI beg of you to know me, good my lord,To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lastsTo entertain me as your steward still.TIMONHad I a stewardSo true, so just, and now so comfortable?It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.Let me behold thy face. Surely, this manWas born of woman.Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaimOne honest man--mistake me not--but one;No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.How fain would I have hated all mankind!And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,I fell with curses.Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;For, by oppressing and betraying me,Thou mightst have sooner got another service:For many so arrive at second masters,Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,Expecting in return twenty for one?FLAVIUSNo, my most worthy master; in whose breastDoubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:Suspect still comes where an estate is least.That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,Care of your food and living; and, believe it,My most honour'd lord,For any benefit that points to me,Either in hope or present, I'ld exchangeFor this one wish, that you had power and wealthTo requite me, by making rich yourself.TIMONLook thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,Here, take: the gods out of my miseryHave sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogsWhat thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men likeblasted woods,And may diseases lick up their false bloods!And so farewell and thrive.FLAVIUSO, let me stay,And comfort you, my master.TIMONIf thou hatest curses,Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his caveACT VSCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching them from his cavePainterAs I took note of the place, it cannot be far wherehe abides.PoetWhat's to be thought of him? does the rumour holdfor true, that he's so full of gold?PainterCertain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia andTimandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poorstraggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis saidhe gave unto his steward a mighty sum.PoetThen this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.PainterNothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athensagain, and flourish with the highest. Therefore'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in thissupposed distress of his: it will show honestly inus; and is very likely to load our purposes withwhat they travail for, if it be a just true reportthat goes of his having.PoetWhat have you now to present unto him?PainterNothing at this time but my visitation: only I willpromise him an excellent piece.PoetI must serve him so too, tell him of an intentthat's coming toward him.PainterGood as the best. Promising is the very air o' thetime: it opens the eyes of expectation:performance is ever the duller for his act; and,but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, thedeed of saying is quite out of use. To promise ismost courtly and fashionable: performance is a kindof will or testament which argues a great sicknessin his judgment that makes it.TIMON comes from his cave, behindTIMON[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint aman so bad as is thyself.PoetI am thinking what I shall say I have provided forhim: it must be a personating of himself; a satireagainst the softness of prosperity, with a discoveryof the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.TIMON[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain inthine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults inother men? Do so, I have gold for thee.PoetNay, let's seek him:Then do we sin against our own estate,When we may profit meet, and come too late.PainterTrue;When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.TIMON[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What agod's gold,That he is worshipp'd in a baser templeThan where swine feed!'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,Settlest admired reverence in a slave:To thee be worship! and thy saints for ayeBe crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!Fit I meet them.Coming forwardPoetHail, worthy Timon!PainterOur late noble master!TIMONHave I once lived to see two honest men?PoetSir,Having often of your open bounty tasted,Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:What! to you,Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influenceTo their whole being! I am rapt and cannot coverThe monstrous bulk of this ingratitudeWith any size of words.TIMONLet it go naked, men may see't the better:You that are honest, by being what you are,Make them best seen and known.PainterHe and myselfHave travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,And sweetly felt it.TIMONAy, you are honest men.PainterWe are hither come to offer you our service.TIMONMost honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.BothWhat we can do, we'll do, to do you service.TIMONYe're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.PainterSo it is said, my noble lord; but thereforeCame not my friend nor I.TIMONGood honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeitBest in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;Thou counterfeit'st most lively.PainterSo, so, my lord.TIMONE'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smoothThat thou art even natural in thine art.But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,I must needs say you have a little fault:Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish IYou take much pains to mend.BothBeseech your honourTo make it known to us.TIMONYou'll take it ill.BothMost thankfully, my lord.TIMONWill you, indeed?BothDoubt it not, worthy lord.TIMONThere's never a one of you but trusts a knave,That mightily deceives you.BothDo we, my lord?TIMONAy, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,Keep in your bosom: yet remain assuredThat he's a made-up villain.PainterI know none such, my lord.PoetNor I.TIMONLook you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,Rid me these villains from your companies:Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,Confound them by some course, and come to me,I'll give you gold enough.BothName them, my lord, let's know them.TIMONYou that way and you this, but two in company;Each man apart, all single and alone,Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.If where thou art two villains shall not be,Come not near him. If thou wouldst not resideBut where one villain is, then him abandon.Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:To PainterYou have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!To PoetYou are an alchemist; make gold of that.Out, rascal dogs!Beats them out, and then retires to his caveEnter FLAVIUS and two SenatorsFLAVIUSIt is in vain that you would speak with Timon;For he is set so only to himselfThat nothing but himself which looks like manIs friendly with him.First SenatorBring us to his cave:It is our part and promise to the AtheniansTo speak with Timon.Second SenatorAt all times alikeMen are not still the same: 'twas time and griefsThat framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,Offering the fortunes of his former days,The former man may make him. Bring us to him,And chance it as it may.FLAVIUSHere is his cave.Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:Speak to them, noble Timon.TIMON comes from his caveTIMONThou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, andbe hang'd:For each true word, a blister! and each falseBe as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,Consuming it with speaking!First SenatorWorthy Timon,--TIMONOf none but such as you, and you of Timon.First SenatorThe senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.TIMONI thank them; and would send them back the plague,Could I but catch it for them.First SenatorO, forgetWhat we are sorry for ourselves in thee.The senators with one consent of loveEntreat thee back to Athens; who have thoughtOn special dignities, which vacant lieFor thy best use and wearing.Second SenatorThey confessToward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:Which now the public body, which doth seldomPlay the recanter, feeling in itselfA lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withalOf its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,Together with a recompense more fruitfulThan their offence can weigh down by the dram;Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealthAs shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirsAnd write in thee the figures of their love,Ever to read them thine.TIMONYou witch me in it;Surprise me to the very brink of tears:Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.First SenatorTherefore, so please thee to return with usAnd of our Athens, thine and ours, to takeThe captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,Allow'd with absolute power and thy good nameLive with authority: so soon we shall drive backOf Alcibiades the approaches wild,Who, like a boar too savage, doth root upHis country's peace.Second SenatorAnd shakes his threatening swordAgainst the walls of Athens.First SenatorTherefore, Timon,--TIMONWell, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,And take our goodly aged men by the beards,Giving our holy virgins to the stainOf contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,In pity of our aged and our youth,I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,While you have throats to answer: for myself,There's not a whittle in the unruly campBut I do prize it at my love beforeThe reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave youTo the protection of the prosperous gods,As thieves to keepers.FLAVIUSStay not, all's in vain.TIMONWhy, I was writing of my epitaph;it will be seen to-morrow: my long sicknessOf health and living now begins to mend,And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,And last so long enough!First SenatorWe speak in vain.TIMONBut yet I love my country, and am notOne that rejoices in the common wreck,As common bruit doth put it.First SenatorThat's well spoke.TIMONCommend me to my loving countrymen,--First SenatorThese words become your lips as they passthorough them.Second SenatorAnd enter in our ears like great triumphersIn their applauding gates.TIMONCommend me to them,And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,Their pangs of love, with other incident throesThat nature's fragile vessel doth sustainIn life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.First SenatorI like this well; he will return again.TIMONI have a tree, which grows here in my close,That mine own use invites me to cut down,And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,Tell Athens, in the sequence of degreeFrom high to low throughout, that whoso pleaseTo stop affliction, let him take his haste,Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.FLAVIUSTrouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.TIMONCome not to me again: but say to Athens,Timon hath made his everlasting mansionUpon the beached verge of the salt flood;Who once a day with his embossed frothThe turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,And let my grave-stone be your oracle.Lips, let sour words go by and language end:What is amiss plague and infection mend!Graves only be men's works and death their gain!Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.Retires to his caveFirst SenatorHis discontents are unremoveablyCoupled to nature.Second SenatorOur hope in him is dead: let us return,And strain what other means is left unto usIn our dear peril.First SenatorIt requires swift foot.ExeuntSCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.Enter two Senators and a MessengerFirst SenatorThou hast painfully discover'd: are his filesAs full as thy report?Messengerhave spoke the least:Besides, his expedition promisesPresent approach.Second SenatorWe stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.MessengerI met a courier, one mine ancient friend;Whom, though in general part we were opposed,Yet our old love made a particular force,And made us speak like friends: this man was ridingFrom Alcibiades to Timon's cave,With letters of entreaty, which importedHis fellowship i' the cause against your city,In part for his sake moved.First SenatorHere come our brothers.Enter the Senators from TIMONThird SenatorNo talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouringDoth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.ExeuntSCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen.Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMONSoldierBy all description this should be the place.Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tombI cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:Our captain hath in every figure skill,An aged interpreter, though young in days:Before proud Athens he's set down by this,Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.ExitSCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powersALCIBIADESSound to this coward and lascivious townOur terrible approach.A parley soundedEnter Senators on the wallsTill now you have gone on and fill'd the timeWith all licentious measure, making your willsThe scope of justice; till now myself and suchAs slept within the shadow of your powerHav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathedOur sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,When crouching marrow in the bearer strongCries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrongShall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,And pursy insolence shall break his windWith fear and horrid flight.First SenatorNoble and young,When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,To wipe out our ingratitude with lovesAbove their quantity.Second SenatorSo did we wooTransformed Timon to our city's loveBy humble message and by promised means:We were not all unkind, nor all deserveThe common stroke of war.First SenatorThese walls of oursWere not erected by their hands from whomYou have received your griefs; nor are they suchThat these great towers, trophies and schoolsshould fallFor private faults in them.Second SenatorNor are they livingWho were the motives that you first went out;Shame that they wanted cunning, in excessHath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,Into our city with thy banners spread:By decimation, and a tithed death--If thy revenges hunger for that foodWhich nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,And by the hazard of the spotted dieLet die the spotted.First SenatorAll have not offended;For those that were, it is not square to takeOn those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kinWhich in the bluster of thy wrath must fallWith those that have offended: like a shepherd,Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,But kill not all together.Second SenatorWhat thou wilt,Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smileThan hew to't with thy sword.First SenatorSet but thy footAgainst our rampired gates, and they shall ope;So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,To say thou'lt enter friendly.Second SenatorThrow thy glove,Or any token of thine honour else,That thou wilt use the wars as thy redressAnd not as our confusion, all thy powersShall make their harbour in our town, till weHave seal'd thy full desire.ALCIBIADESThen there's my glove;Descend, and open your uncharged ports:Those enemies of Timon's and mine ownWhom you yourselves shall set out for reproofFall and no more: and, to atone your fearsWith my more noble meaning, not a manShall pass his quarter, or offend the streamOf regular justice in your city's bounds,But shall be render'd to your public lawsAt heaviest answer.Both'Tis most nobly spoken.ALCIBIADESDescend, and keep your words.The Senators descend, and open the gatesEnter SoldierSoldierMy noble general, Timon is dead;Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;And on his grave-stone this insculpture, whichWith wax I brought away, whose soft impressionInterprets for my poor ignorance.ALCIBIADES[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies awretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:Seek not my name: a plague consume you wickedcaitiffs left!Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and staynot here thy gait.'These well express in thee thy latter spirits:Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those ourdroplets whichFrom niggard nature fall, yet rich conceitTaught thee to make vast Neptune weep for ayeOn thy low grave, on faults forgiven. DeadIs noble Timon: of whose memoryHereafter more. Bring me into your city,And I will use the olive with my sword,Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make eachPrescribe to other as each other's leech.Let our drums strike.Exeunt
