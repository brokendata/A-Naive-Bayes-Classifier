Be thou the trumpet of our wrathAnd sullen presage of your own decay.An honourable conduct let him have:Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKEQUEEN ELINORWhat now, my son! have I not ever saidHow that ambitious Constance would not ceaseTill she had kindled France and all the world,Upon the right and party of her son?This might have been prevented and made wholeWith very easy arguments of love,Which now the manage of two kingdoms mustWith fearful bloody issue arbitrate.KING JOHNOur strong possession and our right for us.QUEEN ELINORYour strong possession much more than your right,Or else it must go wrong with you and me:So much my conscience whispers in your ear,Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.Enter a SheriffESSEXMy liege, here is the strangest controversyCome from country to be judged by you,That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?KING JOHNLet them approach.Our abbeys and our priories shall payThis expedition's charge.Enter ROBERT and the BASTARDWhat men are you?BASTARDYour faithful subject I, a gentlemanBorn in Northamptonshire and eldest son,As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,A soldier, by the honour-giving handOf Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.KING JOHNWhat art thou?ROBERTThe son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.KING JOHNIs that the elder, and art thou the heir?You came not of one mother then, it seems.BASTARDMost certain of one mother, mighty king;That is well known; and, as I think, one father:But for the certain knowledge of that truthI put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.QUEEN ELINOROut on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy motherAnd wound her honour with this diffidence.BASTARDI, madam? no, I have no reason for it;That is my brother's plea and none of mine;The which if he can prove, a' pops me outAt least from fair five hundred pound a year:Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!KING JOHNA good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?BASTARDI know not why, except to get the land.But once he slander'd me with bastardy:But whether I be as true begot or no,That still I lay upon my mother's head,But that I am as well begot, my liege,--Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--Compare our faces and be judge yourself.If old sir Robert did beget us bothAnd were our father and this son like him,O old sir Robert, father, on my kneeI give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!KING JOHNWhy, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!QUEEN ELINORHe hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;The accent of his tongue affecteth him.Do you not read some tokens of my sonIn the large composition of this man?KING JOHNMine eye hath well examined his partsAnd finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,What doth move you to claim your brother's land?BASTARDBecause he hath a half-face, like my father.With half that face would he have all my land:A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!ROBERTMy gracious liege, when that my father lived,Your brother did employ my father much,--BASTARDWell, sir, by this you cannot get my land:Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.ROBERTAnd once dispatch'd him in an embassyTo Germany, there with the emperorTo treat of high affairs touching that time.The advantage of his absence took the kingAnd in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shoresBetween my father and my mother lay,As I have heard my father speak himself,When this same lusty gentleman was got.Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'dHis lands to me, and took it on his deathThat this my mother's son was none of his;And if he were, he came into the worldFull fourteen weeks before the course of time.Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,My father's land, as was my father's will.KING JOHNSirrah, your brother is legitimate;Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,And if she did play false, the fault was hers;Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbandsThat marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,Had of your father claim'd this son for his?In sooth, good friend, your father might have keptThis calf bred from his cow from all the world;In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,My brother might not claim him; nor your father,Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;My mother's son did get your father's heir;Your father's heir must have your father's land.ROBERTShall then my father's will be of no forceTo dispossess that child which is not his?BASTARDOf no more force to dispossess me, sir,Than was his will to get me, as I think.QUEEN ELINORWhether hadst thou rather be a FaulconbridgeAnd like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,Lord of thy presence and no land beside?BASTARDMadam, an if my brother had my shape,And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;And if my legs were two such riding-rods,My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thinThat in mine ear I durst not stick a roseLest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,Would I might never stir from off this place,I would give it every foot to have this face;I would not be sir Nob in any case.QUEEN ELINORI like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?I am a soldier and now bound to France.BASTARDBrother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.QUEEN ELINORNay, I would have you go before me thither.BASTARDOur country manners give our betters way.KING JOHNWhat is thy name?BASTARDPhilip, my liege, so is my name begun,Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.KING JOHNFrom henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.BASTARDBrother by the mother's side, give me your hand:My father gave me honour, yours gave land.Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,When I was got, sir Robert was away!QUEEN ELINORThe very spirit of Plantagenet!I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.BASTARDMadam, by chance but not by truth; what though?Something about, a little from the right,In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,And have is have, however men do catch:Near or far off, well won is still well shot,And I am I, howe'er I was begot.KING JOHNGo, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speedFor France, for France, for it is more than need.BASTARDBrother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.Exeunt all but BASTARDA foot of honour better than I was;But many a many foot of land the worse.Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;For new-made honour doth forget men's names;'Tis too respective and too sociableFor your conversion. Now your traveller,He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,Why then I suck my teeth and catechiseMy picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;And then comes answer like an Absey book:'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;At your employment; at your service, sir;''No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'And so, ere answer knows what question would,Saving in dialogue of compliment,And talking of the Alps and Apennines,The Pyrenean and the river Po,It draws toward supper in conclusion so.But this is worshipful societyAnd fits the mounting spirit like myself,For he is but a bastard to the timeThat doth not smack of observation;And so am I, whether I smack or no;And not alone in habit and device,Exterior form, outward accoutrement,But from the inward motion to deliverSweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:Which, though I will not practise to deceive,Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?What woman-post is this? hath she no husbandThat will take pains to blow a horn before her?Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEYO me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!What brings you here to court so hastily?LADY FAULCONBRIDGEWhere is that slave, thy brother? where is he,That holds in chase mine honour up and down?BASTARDMy brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?LADY FAULCONBRIDGESir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.BASTARDJames Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?GURNEYGood leave, good Philip.BASTARDPhilip! sparrow: James,There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.Exit GURNEYMadam, I was not old sir Robert's son:Sir Robert might have eat his part in meUpon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,To whom am I beholding for these limbs?Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.LADY FAULCONBRIDGEHast thou conspired with thy brother too,That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?BASTARDKnight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;Legitimation, name and all is gone:Then, good my mother, let me know my father;Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?LADY FAULCONBRIDGEHast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?BASTARDAs faithfully as I deny the devil.LADY FAULCONBRIDGEKing Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:By long and vehement suit I was seducedTo make room for him in my husband's bed:Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!Thou art the issue of my dear offence,Which was so strongly urged past my defence.BASTARDNow, by this light, were I to get again,Madam, I would not wish a better father.Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,Subjected tribute to commanding love,Against whose fury and unmatched forceThe aweless lion could not wage the fight,Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.He that perforce robs lions of their heartsMay easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,With all my heart I thank thee for my father!Who lives and dares but say thou didst not wellWhen I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;And they shall say, when Richard me begot,If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.ExeuntACT IISCENE I.

From north to south:Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!First CitizenHear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;Win you this city without stroke or wound;Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,That here come sacrifices for the field:Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.KING JOHNSpeak on with favour; we are bent to hear.First CitizenThat daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,Is niece to England: look upon the yearsOf Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?If zealous love should go in search of virtue,Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?If love ambitious sought a match of birth,Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,Is the young Dauphin every way complete:If not complete of, say he is not she;And she again wants nothing, to name want,If want it be not that she is not he:He is the half part of a blessed man,Left to be finished by such as she;And she a fair divided excellence,Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.O, two such silver currents, when they join,Do glorify the banks that bound them in;And two such shores to two such streams made one,Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,To these two princes, if you marry them.This union shall do more than battery canTo our fast-closed gates; for at this match,With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,And give you entrance: but without this match,The sea enraged is not half so deaf,Lions more confident, mountains and rocksMore free from motion, no, not Death himselfIn moral fury half so peremptory,As we to keep this city.BASTARDHere's a stayThat shakes the rotten carcass of old DeathOut of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,Talks as familiarly of roaring lionsAs maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;He gives the bastinado with his tongue:Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of hisBut buffets better than a fist of France:Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with wordsSince I first call'd my brother's father dad.QUEEN ELINORSon, list to this conjunction, make this match;Give with our niece a dowry large enough:For by this knot thou shalt so surely tieThy now unsured assurance to the crown,That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripeThe bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.I see a yielding in the looks of France;Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their soulsAre capable of this ambition,Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breathOf soft petitions, pity and remorse,Cool and congeal again to what it was.First CitizenWhy answer not the double majestiesThis friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?KING PHILIPSpeak England first, that hath been forward firstTo speak unto this city: what say you?KING JOHNIf that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,And all that we upon this side the sea,Except this city now by us besieged,Find liable to our crown and dignity,Shall gild her bridal bed and make her richIn titles, honours and promotions,As she in beauty, education, blood,Holds hand with any princess of the world.KING PHILIPWhat say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.LEWISI do, my lord; and in her eye I findA wonder, or a wondrous miracle,The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:Which being but the shadow of your son,Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:I do protest I never loved myselfTill now infixed I beheld myselfDrawn in the flattering table of her eye.Whispers with BLANCHBASTARDDrawn in the flattering table of her eye!Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espyHimself love's traitor: this is pity now,That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should beIn such a love so vile a lout as he.BLANCHMy uncle's will in this respect is mine:If he see aught in you that makes him like,That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,I can with ease translate it to my will;Or if you will, to speak more properly,I will enforce it easily to my love.Further I will not flatter you, my lord,That all I see in you is worthy love,Than this; that nothing do I see in you,Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,That I can find should merit any hate.KING JOHNWhat say these young ones? What say you my niece?BLANCHThat she is bound in honour still to doWhat you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.KING JOHNSpeak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?LEWISNay, ask me if I can refrain from love;For I do love her most unfeignedly.KING JOHNThen do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,With her to thee; and this addition more,Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,Command thy son and daughter to join hands.KING PHILIPIt likes us well; young princes, close your hands.AUSTRIAAnd your lips too; for I am well assuredThat I did so when I was first assured.KING PHILIPNow, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,Let in that amity which you have made;For at Saint Mary's chapel presentlyThe rites of marriage shall be solemnized.Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?I know she is not, for this match made upHer presence would have interrupted much:Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.LEWISShe is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.KING PHILIPAnd, by my faith, this league that we have madeWill give her sadness very little cure.Brother of England, how may we contentThis widow lady? In her right we came;Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,To our own vantage.KING JOHNWe will heal up all;For we'll create young Arthur Duke of BretagneAnd Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair townWe make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;Some speedy messenger bid her repairTo our solemnity: I trust we shall,If not fill up the measure of her will,Yet in some measure satisfy her soThat we shall stop her exclamation.Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.Exeunt all but the BASTARDBASTARDMad world! mad kings! mad composition!John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,Hath willingly departed with a part,And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,Whom zeal and charity brought to the fieldAs God's own soldier, rounded in the earWith that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,Who, having no external thing to loseBut the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,Commodity, the bias of the world,The world, who of itself is peised well,Made to run even upon even ground,Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,This sway of motion, this Commodity,Makes it take head from all indifferency,From all direction, purpose, course, intent:And this same bias, this Commodity,This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,From a resolved and honourable war,To a most base and vile-concluded peace.And why rail I on this Commodity?But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,When his fair angels would salute my palm;But for my hand, as unattempted yet,Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will railAnd say there is no sin but to be rich;And being rich, my virtue then shall beTo say there is no vice but beggary.Since kings break faith upon commodity,Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.ExitACT IIISCENE I.

so jest with heaven,Make such unconstant children of ourselves,As now again to snatch our palm from palm,Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bedOf smiling peace to march a bloody host,And make a riot on the gentle browOf true sincerity? O, holy sir,My reverend father, let it not be so!Out of your grace, devise, ordain, imposeSome gentle order; and then we shall be blestTo do your pleasure and continue friends.CARDINAL PANDULPHAll form is formless, order orderless,Save what is opposite to England's love.Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,A mother's curse, on her revolting son.France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,A chafed lion by the mortal paw,A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.KING PHILIPI may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.CARDINAL PANDULPHSo makest thou faith an enemy to faith;And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vowFirst made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,That is, to be the champion of our church!What since thou sworest is sworn against thyselfAnd may not be performed by thyself,For that which thou hast sworn to do amissIs not amiss when it is truly done,And being not done, where doing tends to ill,The truth is then most done not doing it:The better act of purposes mistookIs to mistake again; though indirect,Yet indirection thereby grows direct,And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fireWithin the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.It is religion that doth make vows kept;But thou hast sworn against religion,By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,And makest an oath the surety for thy truthAgainst an oath: the truth thou art unsureTo swear, swears only not to be forsworn;Else what a mockery should it be to swear!But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.Therefore thy later vows against thy firstIs in thyself rebellion to thyself;And better conquest never canst thou makeThan arm thy constant and thy nobler partsAgainst these giddy loose suggestions:Upon which better part our prayers come in,If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then knowThe peril of our curses light on theeSo heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,But in despair die under their black weight.AUSTRIARebellion, flat rebellion!BASTARDWill't not be?Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?LEWISFather, to arms!BLANCHUpon thy wedding-day?Against the blood that thou hast married?What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how newIs husband in my mouth! even for that name,Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,Upon my knee I beg, go not to armsAgainst mine uncle.CONSTANCEO, upon my knee,Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doomForethought by heaven!BLANCHNow shall I see thy love: what motive mayBe stronger with thee than the name of wife?CONSTANCEThat which upholdeth him that thee upholds,His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!LEWISI muse your majesty doth seem so cold,When such profound respects do pull you on.CARDINAL PANDULPHI will denounce a curse upon his head.KING PHILIPThou shalt not need.

O, what love I noteIn the fair multitude of those her hairs!Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friendsDo glue themselves in sociable grief,Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,Sticking together in calamity.CONSTANCETo England, if you will.KING PHILIPBind up your hairs.CONSTANCEYes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud'O that these hands could so redeem my son,As they have given these hairs their liberty!'But now I envy at their liberty,And will again commit them to their bonds,Because my poor child is a prisoner.And, father cardinal, I have heard you sayThat we shall see and know our friends in heaven:If that be true, I shall see my boy again;For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,To him that did but yesterday suspire,There was not such a gracious creature born.But now will canker-sorrow eat my budAnd chase the native beauty from his cheekAnd he will look as hollow as a ghost,As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,And so he'll die; and, rising so again,When I shall meet him in the court of heavenI shall not know him: therefore never, neverMust I behold my pretty Arthur more.CARDINAL PANDULPHYou hold too heinous a respect of grief.CONSTANCEHe talks to me that never had a son.KING PHILIPYou are as fond of grief as of your child.CONSTANCEGrief fills the room up of my absent child,Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,Remembers me of all his gracious parts,Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,I could give better comfort than you do.I will not keep this form upon my head,When there is such disorder in my wit.O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!ExitKING PHILIPI fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.ExitLEWISThere's nothing in this world can make me joy:Life is as tedious as a twice-told taleVexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's tasteThat it yields nought but shame and bitterness.CARDINAL PANDULPHBefore the curing of a strong disease,Even in the instant of repair and health,The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,On their departure most of all show evil:What have you lost by losing of this day?LEWISAll days of glory, joy and happiness.CARDINAL PANDULPHIf you had won it, certainly you had.No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,She looks upon them with a threatening eye.'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lostIn this which he accounts so clearly won:Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?LEWISAs heartily as he is glad he hath him.CARDINAL PANDULPHYour mind is all as youthful as your blood.Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;For even the breath of what I mean to speakShall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,Out of the path which shall directly leadThy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot beThat, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,The misplaced John should entertain an hour,One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly handMust be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;And he that stands upon a slippery placeMakes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;So be it, for it cannot be but so.LEWISBut what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?CARDINAL PANDULPHYou, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,May then make all the claim that Arthur did.LEWISAnd lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.CARDINAL PANDULPHHow green you are and fresh in this old world!John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;For he that steeps his safety in true bloodShall find but bloody safety and untrue.This act so evilly born shall cool the heartsOf all his people and freeze up their zeal,That none so small advantage shall step forthTo cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;No natural exhalation in the sky,No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,No common wind, no customed event,But they will pluck away his natural causeAnd call them meteors, prodigies and signs,Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.LEWISMay be he will not touch young Arthur's life,But hold himself safe in his prisonment.CARDINAL PANDULPHO, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,If that young Arthur be not gone already,Even at that news he dies; and then the heartsOf all his people shall revolt from himAnd kiss the lips of unacquainted changeAnd pick strong matter of revolt and wrathOut of the bloody fingers' ends of John.Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:And, O, what better matter breeds for youThan I have named! The bastard FaulconbridgeIs now in England, ransacking the church,Offending charity: if but a dozen FrenchWere there in arms, they would be as a callTo train ten thousand English to their side,Or as a little snow, tumbled about,Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderfulWhat may be wrought out of their discontent,Now that their souls are topful of offence.For England go: I will whet on the king.LEWISStrong reasons make strong actions: let us go:If you say ay, the king will not say no.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I.

You are sad.HUBERTIndeed, I have been merrier.ARTHURMercy on me!Methinks no body should be sad but I:Yet, I remember, when I was in France,Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,Only for wantonness. By my christendom,So I were out of prison and kept sheep,I should be as merry as the day is long;And so I would be here, but that I doubtMy uncle practises more harm to me:He is afraid of me and I of him:Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heavenI were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.HUBERT[Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prateHe will awake my mercy which lies dead:Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.ARTHURAre you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:In sooth, I would you were a little sick,That I might sit all night and watch with you:I warrant I love you more than you do me.HUBERT[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.Read here, young Arthur.Showing a paperAsideHow now, foolish rheum!Turning dispiteous torture out of door!I must be brief, lest resolution dropOut at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?ARTHURToo fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?HUBERTYoung boy, I must.ARTHURAnd will you?HUBERTAnd I will.ARTHURHave you the heart? When your head did but ache,I knit my handercher about your brows,The best I had, a princess wrought it me,And I did never ask it you again;And with my hand at midnight held your head,And like the watchful minutes to the hour,Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'Many a poor man's son would have lien stillAnd ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;But you at your sick service had a prince.Nay, you may think my love was crafty loveAnd call it cunning: do, an if you will:If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?These eyes that never did nor never shallSo much as frown on you.HUBERTI have sworn to do it;And with hot irons must I burn them out.ARTHURAh, none but in this iron age would do it!The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tearsAnd quench his fiery indignationEven in the matter of mine innocence;Nay, after that, consume away in rustBut for containing fire to harm mine eye.Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?An if an angel should have come to meAnd told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.HUBERTCome forth.StampsRe-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons,  & cDo as I bid you do.ARTHURO, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are outEven with the fierce looks of these bloody men.HUBERTGive me the iron, I say, and bind him here.ARTHURAlas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,Nor look upon the iron angerly:Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,Whatever torment you do put me to.HUBERTGo, stand within; let me alone with him.First ExecutionerI am best pleased to be from such a deed.Exeunt ExecutionersARTHURAlas, I then have chid away my friend!He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:Let him come back, that his compassion mayGive life to yours.HUBERTCome, boy, prepare yourself.ARTHURIs there no remedy?HUBERTNone, but to lose your eyes.ARTHURO heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,Any annoyance in that precious sense!Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.HUBERTIs this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.ARTHURHubert, the utterance of a brace of tonguesMust needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.Though to no use but still to look on you!Lo, by my truth, the instrument is coldAnd would not harm me.HUBERTI can heat it, boy.ARTHURNo, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,Being create for comfort, to be usedIn undeserved extremes: see else yourself;There is no malice in this burning coal;The breath of heaven has blown his spirit outAnd strew'd repentent ashes on his head.HUBERTBut with my breath I can revive it, boy.ARTHURAn if you do, you will but make it blushAnd glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.All things that you should use to do me wrongDeny their office: only you do lackThat mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.HUBERTWell, see to live; I will not touch thine eyeFor all the treasure that thine uncle owes:Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,With this same very iron to burn them out.ARTHURO, now you look like Hubert! all this whileYou were disguised.HUBERTPeace; no more.

KING JOHN'S palace.Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other LordsKING JOHNHere once again we sit, once again crown'd,And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.PEMBROKEThis 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;Fresh expectation troubled not the landWith any long'd-for change or better state.SALISBURYTherefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,To guard a title that was rich before,To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,To throw a perfume on the violet,To smooth the ice, or add another hueUnto the rainbow, or with taper-lightTo seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.PEMBROKEBut that your royal pleasure must be done,This act is as an ancient tale new told,And in the last repeating troublesome,Being urged at a time unseasonable.SALISBURYIn this the antique and well noted faceOf plain old form is much disfigured;And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,Startles and frights consideration,Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.PEMBROKEWhen workmen strive to do better than well,They do confound their skill in covetousness;And oftentimes excusing of a faultDoth make the fault the worse by the excuse,As patches set upon a little breachDiscredit more in hiding of the faultThan did the fault before it was so patch'd.SALISBURYTo this effect, before you were new crown'd,We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highnessTo overbear it, and we are all well pleased,Since all and every part of what we wouldDoth make a stand at what your highness will.KING JOHNSome reasons of this double coronationI have possess'd you with and think them strong;And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,I shall indue you with: meantime but askWhat you would have reform'd that is not well,And well shall you perceive how willinglyI will both hear and grant you your requests.PEMBROKEThen I, as one that am the tongue of these,To sound the purpose of all their hearts,Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,Your safety, for the which myself and themBend their best studies, heartily requestThe enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraintDoth move the murmuring lips of discontentTo break into this dangerous argument,--If what in rest you have in right you hold,Why then your fears, which, as they say, attendThe steps of wrong, should move you to mew upYour tender kinsman and to choke his daysWith barbarous ignorance and deny his youthThe rich advantage of good exercise?That the time's enemies may not have thisTo grace occasions, let it be our suitThat you have bid us ask his liberty;Which for our goods we do no further askThan whereupon our weal, on you depending,Counts it your weal he have his liberty.Enter HUBERTKING JOHNLet it be so: I do commit his youthTo your direction. Hubert, what news with you?Taking him apartPEMBROKEThis is the man should do the bloody deed;He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:The image of a wicked heinous faultLives in his eye; that close aspect of hisDoes show the mood of a much troubled breast;And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.SALISBURYThe colour of the king doth come and goBetween his purpose and his conscience,Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.PEMBROKEAnd when it breaks, I fear will issue thenceThe foul corruption of a sweet child's death.KING JOHNWe cannot hold mortality's strong hand:Good lords, although my will to give is living,The suit which you demand is gone and dead:He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.SALISBURYIndeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.PEMBROKEIndeed we heard how near his death he wasBefore the child himself felt he was sick:This must be answer'd either here or hence.KING JOHNWhy do you bend such solemn brows on me?Think you I bear the shears of destiny?Have I commandment on the pulse of life?SALISBURYIt is apparent foul play; and 'tis shameThat greatness should so grossly offer it:So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.PEMBROKEStay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,And find the inheritance of this poor child,His little kingdom of a forced grave.That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!This must not be thus borne: this will break outTo all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.Exeunt LordsKING JOHNThey burn in indignation. I repent:There is no sure foundation set on blood,No certain life achieved by others' death.Enter a MessengerA fearful eye thou hast: where is that bloodThat I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?So foul a sky clears not without a storm:Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?MessengerFrom France to England. Never such a powerFor any foreign preparationWas levied in the body of a land.The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;For when you should be told they do prepare,The tidings come that they are all arrived.KING JOHNO, where hath our intelligence been drunk?Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,That such an army could be drawn in France,And she not hear of it?MessengerMy liege, her earIs stopp'd with dust; the first of April diedYour noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,The Lady Constance in a frenzy diedThree days before: but this from rumour's tongueI idly heard; if true or false I know not.KING JOHNWithhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!O, make a league with me, till I have pleasedMy discontented peers! What! mother dead!How wildly then walks my estate in France!Under whose conduct came those powers of FranceThat thou for truth givest out are landed here?MessengerUnder the Dauphin.KING JOHNThou hast made me giddyWith these ill tidings.Enter the BASTARD and PETER of PomfretNow, what says the worldTo your proceedings? do not seek to stuffMy head with more ill news, for it is full.BASTARDBut if you be afeard to hear the worst,Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.KING JOHNBear with me cousin, for I was amazedUnder the tide: but now I breathe againAloft the flood, and can give audienceTo any tongue, speak it of what it will.BASTARDHow I have sped among the clergymen,The sums I have collected shall express.But as I travell'd hither through the land,I find the people strangely fantasied;Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:And here a prophet, that I brought with meFrom forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I foundWith many hundreds treading on his heels;To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,Your highness should deliver up your crown.KING JOHNThou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?PETERForeknowing that the truth will fall out so.KING JOHNHubert, away with him; imprison him;And on that day at noon whereon he saysI shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.Deliver him to safety; and return,For I must use thee.Exeunt HUBERT with PETERO my gentle cousin,Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?BASTARDThe French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,And others more, going to seek the graveOf Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-nightOn your suggestion.KING JOHNGentle kinsman, go,And thrust thyself into their companies:I have a way to win their loves again;Bring them before me.BASTARDI will seek them out.KING JOHNNay, but make haste; the better foot before.O, let me have no subject enemies,When adverse foreigners affright my townsWith dreadful pomp of stout invasion!Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,And fly like thought from them to me again.BASTARDThe spirit of the time shall teach me speed.ExitKING JOHNSpoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.Go after him; for he perhaps shall needSome messenger betwixt me and the peers;And be thou he.MessengerWith all my heart, my liege.ExitKING JOHNMy mother dead!Re-enter HUBERTHUBERTMy lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl aboutThe other four in wondrous motion.KING JOHNFive moons!HUBERTOld men and beldams in the streetsDo prophesy upon it dangerously:Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:And when they talk of him, they shake their headsAnd whisper one another in the ear;And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,Standing on slippers, which his nimble hasteHad falsely thrust upon contrary feet,Told of a many thousand warlike FrenchThat were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:Another lean unwash'd artificerCuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.KING JOHNWhy seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty causeTo wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.HUBERTNo had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?KING JOHNIt is the curse of kings to be attendedBy slaves that take their humours for a warrantTo break within the bloody house of life,And on the winking of authorityTo understand a law, to know the meaningOf dangerous majesty, when perchance it frownsMore upon humour than advised respect.HUBERTHere is your hand and seal for what I did.KING JOHNO, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earthIs to be made, then shall this hand and sealWitness against us to damnation!How oft the sight of means to do ill deedsMake deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,This murder had not come into my mind:But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,Finding thee fit for bloody villany,Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;And thou, to be endeared to a king,Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.HUBERTMy lord--KING JOHNHadst thou but shook thy head or made a pauseWhen I spake darkly what I purposed,Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,As bid me tell my tale in express words,Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:But thou didst understand me by my signsAnd didst in signs again parley with sin;Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,And consequently thy rude hand to actThe deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.Out of my sight, and never see me more!My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,Hostility and civil tumult reignsBetween my conscience and my cousin's death.HUBERTArm you against your other enemies,I'll make a peace between your soul and you.Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mineIs yet a maiden and an innocent hand,Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.Within this bosom never enter'd yetThe dreadful motion of a murderous thought;And you have slander'd nature in my form,Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,Is yet the cover of a fairer mindThan to be butcher of an innocent child.KING JOHNDoth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,Throw this report on their incensed rage,And make them tame to their obedience!Forgive the comment that my passion madeUpon thy feature; for my rage was blind,And foul imaginary eyes of bloodPresented thee more hideous than thou art.O, answer not, but to my closet bringThe angry lords with all expedient haste.I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.ExeuntSCENE III. Before the castle.Enter ARTHUR, on the wallsARTHURThe wall is high, and yet will I leap down:Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!There's few or none do know me: if they did,This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.If I get down, and do not break my limbs,I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:As good to die and go, as die and stay.Leaps downO me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!DiesEnter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOTSALISBURYLords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:It is our safety, and we must embraceThis gentle offer of the perilous time.PEMBROKEWho brought that letter from the cardinal?SALISBURYThe Count Melun, a noble lord of France,Whose private with me of the Dauphin's loveIs much more general than these lines import.BIGOTTo-morrow morning let us meet him then.SALISBURYOr rather then set forward; for 'twill beTwo long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.Enter the BASTARDBASTARDOnce more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!The king by me requests your presence straight.SALISBURYThe king hath dispossess'd himself of us:We will not line his thin bestained cloakWith our pure honours, nor attend the footThat leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.Return and tell him so: we know the worst.BASTARDWhate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.SALISBURYOur griefs, and not our manners, reason now.BASTARDBut there is little reason in your grief;Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.PEMBROKESir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.BASTARD'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.SALISBURYThis is the prison. What is he lies here?Seeing ARTHURPEMBROKEO death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.SALISBURYMurder, as hating what himself hath done,Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.BIGOTOr, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,Found it too precious-princely for a grave.SALISBURYSir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,Or have you read or heard? or could you think?Or do you almost think, although you see,That you do see? could thought, without this object,Form such another? This is the very top,The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring ragePresented to the tears of soft remorse.PEMBROKEAll murders past do stand excused in this:And this, so sole and so unmatchable,Shall give a holiness, a purity,To the yet unbegotten sin of times;And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,Exampled by this heinous spectacle.BASTARDIt is a damned and a bloody work;The graceless action of a heavy hand,If that it be the work of any hand.SALISBURYIf that it be the work of any hand!We had a kind of light what would ensue:It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;The practise and the purpose of the king:From whose obedience I forbid my soul,Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,And breathing to his breathless excellenceThe incense of a vow, a holy vow,Never to taste the pleasures of the world,Never to be infected with delight,Nor conversant with ease and idleness,Till I have set a glory to this hand,By giving it the worship of revenge.PEMBROKEBIGOTOur souls religiously confirm thy words.Enter HUBERTHUBERTLords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.SALISBURYO, he is old and blushes not at death.Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!HUBERTI am no villain.SALISBURYMust I rob the law?Drawing his swordBASTARDYour sword is bright, sir; put it up again.SALISBURYNot till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.HUBERTStand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;Lest I, by marking of your rage, forgetYour worth, your greatness and nobility.BIGOTOut, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?HUBERTNot for my life: but yet I dare defendMy innocent life against an emperor.SALISBURYThou art a murderer.HUBERTDo not prove me so;Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.PEMBROKECut him to pieces.BASTARDKeep the peace, I say.SALISBURYStand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.BASTARDThou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,That you shall think the devil is come from hell.BIGOTWhat wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?Second a villain and a murderer?HUBERTLord Bigot, I am none.BIGOTWho kill'd this prince?HUBERT'Tis not an hour since I left him well:I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weepMy date of life out for his sweet life's loss.SALISBURYTrust not those cunning waters of his eyes,For villany is not without such rheum;And he, long traded in it, makes it seemLike rivers of remorse and innocency.Away with me, all you whose souls abhorThe uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;For I am stifled with this smell of sin.BIGOTAway toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!PEMBROKEThere tell the king he may inquire us out.Exeunt LordsBASTARDHere's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?Beyond the infinite and boundless reachOf mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,Art thou damn'd, Hubert.HUBERTDo but hear me, sir.BASTARDHa! I'll tell thee what;Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hellAs thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.HUBERTUpon my soul--BASTARDIf thou didst but consentTo this most cruel act, do but despair;And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest threadThat ever spider twisted from her wombWill serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beamTo hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,Put but a little water in a spoon,And it shall be as all the ocean,Enough to stifle such a villain up.I do suspect thee very grievously.HUBERTIf I in act, consent, or sin of thought,Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breathWhich was embounded in this beauteous clay,Let hell want pains enough to torture me.I left him well.BASTARDGo, bear him in thine arms.I am amazed, methinks, and lose my wayAmong the thorns and dangers of this world.How easy dost thou take all England up!From forth this morsel of dead royalty,The life, the right and truth of all this realmIs fled to heaven; and England now is leftTo tug and scamble and to part by the teethThe unowed interest of proud-swelling state.Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majestyDoth dogged war bristle his angry crestAnd snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:Now powers from home and discontents at homeMeet in one line; and vast confusion waits,As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,The imminent decay of wrested pomp.Now happy he whose cloak and cincture canHold out this tempest. Bear away that childAnd follow me with speed: I'll to the king:A thousand businesses are brief in hand,And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.ExeuntACT VSCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and AttendantsKING JOHNThus have I yielded up into your handThe circle of my glory.Giving the crownCARDINAL PANDULPHTake againFrom this my hand, as holding of the popeYour sovereign greatness and authority.KING JOHNNow keep your holy word: go meet the French,And from his holiness use all your powerTo stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.Our discontented counties do revolt;Our people quarrel with obedience,Swearing allegiance and the love of soulTo stranger blood, to foreign royalty.This inundation of mistemper'd humourRests by you only to be qualified:Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,That present medicine must be minister'd,Or overthrow incurable ensues.CARDINAL PANDULPHIt was my breath that blew this tempest up,Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;But since you are a gentle convertite,My tongue shall hush again this storm of warAnd make fair weather in your blustering land.On this Ascension-day, remember well,Upon your oath of service to the pope,Go I to make the French lay down their arms.ExitKING JOHNIs this Ascension-day? Did not the prophetSay that before Ascension-day at noonMy crown I should give off? Even so I have:I did suppose it should be on constraint:But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.Enter the BASTARDBASTARDAll Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds outBut Dover castle: London hath received,Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:Your nobles will not hear you, but are goneTo offer service to your enemy,And wild amazement hurries up and downThe little number of your doubtful friends.KING JOHNWould not my lords return to me again,After they heard young Arthur was alive?BASTARDThey found him dead and cast into the streets,An empty casket, where the jewel of lifeBy some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.KING JOHNThat villain Hubert told me he did live.BASTARDSo, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?Be great in act, as you have been in thought;Let not the world see fear and sad distrustGovern the motion of a kingly eye:Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;Threaten the threatener and outface the browOf bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,That borrow their behaviors from the great,Grow great by your example and put onThe dauntless spirit of resolution.Away, and glister like the god of war,When he intendeth to become the field:Show boldness and aspiring confidence.What, shall they seek the lion in his den,And fright him there? and make him tremble there?O, let it not be said: forage, and runTo meet displeasure farther from the doors,And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.KING JOHNThe legate of the pope hath been with me,And I have made a happy peace with him;And he hath promised to dismiss the powersLed by the Dauphin.BASTARDO inglorious league!Shall we, upon the footing of our land,Send fair-play orders and make compromise,Insinuation, parley and base truceTo arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,Mocking the air with colours idly spread,And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;Or if he do, let it at least be saidThey saw we had a purpose of defence.KING JOHNHave thou the ordering of this present time.BASTARDAway, then, with good courage! yet, I know,Our party may well meet a prouder foe.ExeuntSCENE II. LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and SoldiersLEWISMy Lord Melun, let this be copied out,And keep it safe for our remembrance:Return the precedent to these lords again;That, having our fair order written down,Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,May know wherefore we took the sacramentAnd keep our faiths firm and inviolable.SALISBURYUpon our sides it never shall be broken.And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swearA voluntary zeal and an unurged faithTo your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,I am not glad that such a sore of timeShould seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,And heal the inveterate canker of one woundBy making many. O, it grieves my soul,That I must draw this metal from my sideTo be a widow-maker! O, and thereWhere honourable rescue and defenceCries out upon the name of Salisbury!But such is the infection of the time,That, for the health and physic of our right,We cannot deal but with the very handOf stern injustice and confused wrong.And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,That we, the sons and children of this isle,Were born to see so sad an hour as this;Wherein we step after a stranger marchUpon her gentle bosom, and fill upHer enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weepUpon the spot of this enforced cause,--To grace the gentry of a land remote,And follow unacquainted colours here?What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;Where these two Christian armies might combineThe blood of malice in a vein of league,And not to spend it so unneighbourly!LEWISA noble temper dost thou show in this;And great affections wrestling in thy bosomDoth make an earthquake of nobility.O, what a noble combat hast thou foughtBetween compulsion and a brave respect!Let me wipe off this honourable dew,That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,Being an ordinary inundation;But this effusion of such manly drops,This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazedThan had I seen the vaulty top of heavenFigured quite o'er with burning meteors.Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,And with a great heart heave away the storm:Commend these waters to those baby eyesThat never saw the giant world enraged;Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deepInto the purse of rich prosperityAs Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.And even there, methinks, an angel spake:Enter CARDINAL PANDULPHLook, where the holy legate comes apace,To give us warrant from the hand of heavenAnd on our actions set the name of rightWith holy breath.CARDINAL PANDULPHHail, noble prince of France!The next is this, King John hath reconciledHimself to Rome; his spirit is come in,That so stood out against the holy church,The great metropolis and see of Rome:Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;And tame the savage spirit of wild war,That like a lion foster'd up at hand,It may lie gently at the foot of peace,And be no further harmful than in show.LEWISYour grace shall pardon me, I will not back:I am too high-born to be propertied,To be a secondary at control,Or useful serving-man and instrument,To any sovereign state throughout the world.Your breath first kindled the dead coal of warsBetween this chastised kingdom and myself,And brought in matter that should feed this fire;And now 'tis far too huge to be blown outWith that same weak wind which enkindled it.You taught me how to know the face of right,Acquainted me with interest to this land,Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;And come ye now to tell me John hath madeHis peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I backBecause that John hath made his peace with Rome?Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,What men provided, what munition sent,To underprop this action? Is't not IThat undergo this charge? who else but I,And such as to my claim are liable,Sweat in this business and maintain this war?Have I not heard these islanders shout out'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?Have I not here the best cards for the game,To win this easy match play'd for a crown?And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.CARDINAL PANDULPHYou look but on the outside of this work.LEWISOutside or inside, I will not returnTill my attempt so much be glorifiedAs to my ample hope was promisedBefore I drew this gallant head of war,And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,To outlook conquest and to win renownEven in the jaws of danger and of death.Trumpet soundsWhat lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?Enter the BASTARD, attendedBASTARDAccording to the fair play of the world,Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:My holy lord of Milan, from the kingI come, to learn how you have dealt for him;And, as you answer, I do know the scopeAnd warrant limited unto my tongue.CARDINAL PANDULPHThe Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,And will not temporize with my entreaties;He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.BASTARDBy all the blood that ever fury breathed,The youth says well. Now hear our English king;For thus his royalty doth speak in me.He is prepared, and reason too he should:This apish and unmannerly approach,This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,The king doth smile at; and is well preparedTo whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,From out the circle of his territories.That hand which had the strength, even at your door,To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,To dive like buckets in concealed wells,To crouch in litter of your stable planks,To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety outIn vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shakeEven at the crying of your nation's crow,Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,That in your chambers gave you chastisement?No: know the gallant monarch is in armsAnd like an eagle o'er his aery towers,To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,You bloody Neroes, ripping up the wombOf your dear mother England, blush for shame;For your own ladies and pale-visaged maidsLike Amazons come tripping after drums,Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,Their needles to lances, and their gentle heartsTo fierce and bloody inclination.LEWISThere end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;We hold our time too precious to be spentWith such a brabbler.CARDINAL PANDULPHGive me leave to speak.BASTARDNo, I will speak.LEWISWe will attend to neither.Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of warPlead for our interest and our being here.BASTARDIndeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;And so shall you, being beaten: do but startAn echo with the clamour of thy drum,And even at hand a drum is ready bracedThat shall reverberate all as loud as thine;Sound but another, and another shallAs loud as thine rattle the welkin's earAnd mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,Not trusting to this halting legate here,Whom he hath used rather for sport than needIs warlike John; and in his forehead sitsA bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this dayTo feast upon whole thousands of the French.LEWISStrike up our drums, to find this danger out.BASTARDAnd thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.ExeuntSCENE III.

Away, my friends! New flight;And happy newness, that intends old right.Exeunt, leading off MELUNSCENE V. The French camp.Enter LEWIS and his trainLEWISThe sun of heaven methought was loath to set,But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,When English measure backward their own groundIn faint retire. O, bravely came we off,When with a volley of our needless shot,After such bloody toil, we bid good night;And wound our tattering colours clearly up,Last in the field, and almost lords of it!Enter a MessengerMessengerWhere is my prince, the Dauphin?LEWISHere: what news?MessengerThe Count Melun is slain; the English lordsBy his persuasion are again fall'n off,And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.LEWISAh, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!I did not think to be so sad to-nightAs this hath made me. Who was he that saidKing John did fly an hour or two beforeThe stumbling night did part our weary powers?MessengerWhoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.LEWISWell; keep good quarter and good care to-night:The day shall not be up so soon as I,To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.ExeuntSCENE VI.

The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOTPRINCE HENRYIt is too late: the life of all his bloodIs touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,Doth by the idle comments that it makesForetell the ending of mortality.Enter PEMBROKEPEMBROKEHis highness yet doth speak, and holds beliefThat, being brought into the open air,It would allay the burning qualityOf that fell poison which assaileth him.PRINCE HENRYLet him be brought into the orchard here.Doth he still rage?Exit BIGOTPEMBROKEHe is more patientThan when you left him; even now he sung.PRINCE HENRYO vanity of sickness! fierce extremesIn their continuance will not feel themselves.Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,Leaves them invisible, and his siege is nowAgainst the mind, the which he pricks and woundsWith many legions of strange fantasies,Whi ch, in their throng and press to that last hold,Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that deathshould sing.I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,And from the organ-pipe of frailty singsHis soul and body to their lasting rest.SALISBURYBe of good comfort, prince; for you are bornTo set a form upon that indigestWhich he hath left so shapeless and so rude.Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chairKING JOHNAy, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;It would not out at windows nor at doors.There is so hot a summer in my bosom,That all my bowels crumble up to dust:I am a scribbled form, drawn with a penUpon a parchment, and against this fireDo I shrink up.PRINCE HENRYHow fares your majesty?KING JOHNPoison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:And none of you will bid the winter comeTo thrust his icy fingers in my maw,Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their courseThrough my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the northTo make his bleak winds kiss my parched lipsAnd comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,I beg cold comfort; and you are so straitAnd so ingrateful, you deny me that.PRINCE HENRYO that there were some virtue in my tears,That might relieve you!KING JOHNThe salt in them is hot.Within me is a hell; and there the poisonIs as a fiend confined to tyrannizeOn unreprievable condemned blood.Enter the BASTARDBASTARDO, I am scalded with my violent motion,And spleen of speed to see your majesty!KING JOHNO cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sailAre turned to one thread, one little hair:My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,Which holds but till thy news be uttered;And then all this thou seest is but a clodAnd module of confounded royalty.BASTARDThe Dauphin is preparing hitherward,Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;For in a night the best part of my power,As I upon advantage did remove,Were in the Washes all unwarilyDevoured by the unexpected flood.KING JOHN diesSALISBURYYou breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.PRINCE HENRYEven so must I run on, and even so stop.What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,When this was now a king, and now is clay?BASTARDArt thou gone so? I do but stay behindTo do the office for thee of revenge,And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,As it on earth hath been thy servant still.Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,And instantly return with me again,To push destruction and perpetual shameOut of the weak door of our fainting land.Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;The Dauphin rages at our very heels.SALISBURYIt seems you know not, then, so much as we:The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,And brings from him such offers of our peaceAs we with honour and respect may take,With purpose presently to leave this war.BASTARDHe will the rather do it when he seesOurselves well sinewed to our defence.SALISBURYNay, it is in a manner done already;For many carriages he hath dispatch'dTo the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrelTo the disposing of the cardinal:With whom yourself, myself and other lords,If you think meet, this afternoon will postTo consummate this business happily.BASTARDLet it be so: and you, my noble prince,With other princes that may best be spared,Shall wait upon your father's funeral.PRINCE HENRYAt Worcester must his body be interr'd;For so he will'd it.BASTARDThither shall it then:And happily may your sweet self put onThe lineal state and glory of the land!To whom with all submission, on my kneeI do bequeath my faithful servicesAnd true subjection everlastingly.SALISBURYAnd the like tender of our love we make,To rest without a spot for evermore.PRINCE HENRYI have a kind soul that would give you thanksAnd knows not how to do it but with tears.BASTARDO, let us pay the time but needful woe,Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.This England never did, nor never shall,Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,But when it first did help to wound itself.Now these her princes are come home again,Come the three corners of the world in arms,And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,If England to itself do rest but true.Exeunt
