ACT ISCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and AttendantsDUKE VINCENTIOEscalus.ESCALUSMy lord.DUKE VINCENTIOOf government the properties to unfold,Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;Since I am put to know that your own scienceExceeds, in that, the lists of all adviceMy strength can give you: then no more remains,But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,And let them work. The nature of our people,Our city's institutions, and the termsFor common justice, you're as pregnant inAs art and practise hath enriched anyThat we remember. There is our commission,From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,I say, bid come before us Angelo.Exit an AttendantWhat figure of us think you he will bear?For you must know, we have with special soulElected him our absence to supply,Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,And given his deputation all the organsOf our own power: what think you of it?ESCALUSIf any in Vienna be of worthTo undergo such ample grace and honour,It is Lord Angelo.DUKE VINCENTIOLook where he comes.Enter ANGELOANGELOAlways obedient to your grace's will,I come to know your pleasure.DUKE VINCENTIOAngelo,There is a kind of character in thy life,That to the observer doth thy historyFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongingsAre not thine own so proper as to wasteThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,Not light them for themselves; for if our virtuesDid not go forth of us, 'twere all alikeAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'dBut to fine issues, nor Nature never lendsThe smallest scruple of her excellenceBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determinesHerself the glory of a creditor,Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speechTo one that can my part in him advertise;Hold therefore, Angelo:--In our remove be thou at full ourself;Mortality and mercy in ViennaLive in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,Though first in question, is thy secondary.Take thy commission.ANGELONow, good my lord,Let there be some more test made of my metal,Before so noble and so great a figureBe stamp'd upon it.DUKE VINCENTIONo more evasion:We have with a leaven'd and prepared choiceProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.Our haste from hence is of so quick conditionThat it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'dMatters of needful value. We shall write to you,As time and our concernings shall importune,How it goes with us, and do look to knowWhat doth befall you here. So, fare you well;To the hopeful execution do I leave youOf your commissions.ANGELOYet give leave, my lord,That we may bring you something on the way.DUKE VINCENTIOMy haste may not admit it;Nor need you, on mine honour, have to doWith any scruple; your scope is as mine ownSo to enforce or qualify the lawsAs to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:I'll privily away. I love the people,But do not like to stage me to their eyes:Through it do well, I do not relish wellTheir loud applause and Aves vehement;Nor do I think the man of safe discretionThat does affect it. Once more, fare you well.ANGELOThe heavens give safety to your purposes!ESCALUSLead forth and bring you back in happiness!DUKEI thank you. Fare you well.ExitESCALUSI shall desire you, sir, to give me leaveTo have free speech with you; and it concerns meTo look into the bottom of my place:A power I have, but of what strength and natureI am not yet instructed.ANGELO'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,And we may soon our satisfaction haveTouching that point.ESCALUSI'll wait upon your honour.ExeuntSCENE II. A Street.Enter LUCIO and two GentlemenLUCIOIf the duke with the other dukes come not tocomposition with the King of Hungary, why then allthe dukes fall upon the king.First GentlemanHeaven grant us its peace, but not the King ofHungary's!Second GentlemanAmen.LUCIOThou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, thatwent to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrapedone out of the table.Second Gentleman'Thou shalt not steal'?LUCIOAy, that he razed.First GentlemanWhy, 'twas a commandment to command the captain andall the rest from their functions: they put forthto steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, inthe thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petitionwell that prays for peace.Second GentlemanI never heard any soldier dislike it.LUCIOI believe thee; for I think thou never wast wheregrace was said.Second GentlemanNo? a dozen times at least.First GentlemanWhat, in metre?LUCIOIn any proportion or in any language.First GentlemanI think, or in any religion.LUCIOAy, why not? Grace is grace, despite of allcontroversy: as, for example, thou thyself art awicked villain, despite of all grace.First GentlemanWell, there went but a pair of shears between us.LUCIOI grant; as there may between the lists and thevelvet. Thou art the list.First GentlemanAnd thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rta three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as liefbe a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thouart piled, for a French velvet. Do I speakfeelingly now?LUCIOI think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painfulfeeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine ownconfession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst Ilive, forget to drink after thee.First GentlemanI think I have done myself wrong, have I not?Second GentlemanYes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.LUCIOBehold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! Ihave purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--Second GentlemanTo what, I pray?LUCIOJudge.Second GentlemanTo three thousand dolours a year.First GentlemanAy, and more.LUCIOA French crown more.First GentlemanThou art always figuring diseases in me; but thouart full of error; I am sound.LUCIONay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound asthings that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;impiety has made a feast of thee.Enter MISTRESS OVERDONEFirst GentlemanHow now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?MISTRESS OVERDONEWell, well; there's one yonder arrested and carriedto prison was worth five thousand of you all.Second GentlemanWho's that, I pray thee?MISTRESS OVERDONEMarry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.First GentlemanClaudio to prison? 'tis not so.MISTRESS OVERDONENay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, sawhim carried away; and, which is more, within thesethree days his head to be chopped off.LUCIOBut, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.Art thou sure of this?MISTRESS OVERDONEI am too sure of it: and it is for getting MadamJulietta with child.LUCIOBelieve me, this may be: he promised to meet me twohours since, and he was ever precise inpromise-keeping.Second GentlemanBesides, you know, it draws something near to thespeech we had to such a purpose.First GentlemanBut, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.LUCIOAway! let's go learn the truth of it.Exeunt LUCIO and GentlemenMISTRESS OVERDONEThus, what with the war, what with the sweat, whatwith the gallows and what with poverty, I amcustom-shrunk.Enter POMPEYHow now! what's the news with you?POMPEYYonder man is carried to prison.MISTRESS OVERDONEWell; what has he done?POMPEYA woman.MISTRESS OVERDONEBut what's his offence?POMPEYGroping for trouts in a peculiar river.MISTRESS OVERDONEWhat, is there a maid with child by him?POMPEYNo, but there's a woman with maid by him. You havenot heard of the proclamation, have you?MISTRESS OVERDONEWhat proclamation, man?POMPEYAll houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.MISTRESS OVERDONEAnd what shall become of those in the city?POMPEYThey shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,but that a wise burgher put in for them.MISTRESS OVERDONEBut shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs bepulled down?POMPEYTo the ground, mistress.MISTRESS OVERDONEWhy, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!What shall become of me?POMPEYCome; fear you not: good counsellors lack noclients: though you change your place, you need notchange your trade; I'll be your tapster still.Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you thathave worn your eyes almost out in the service, youwill be considered.MISTRESS OVERDONEWhat's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.POMPEYHere comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost toprison; and there's Madam Juliet.ExeuntEnter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and OfficersCLAUDIOFellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?Bear me to prison, where I am committed.ProvostI do it not in evil disposition,But from Lord Angelo by special charge.CLAUDIOThus can the demigod AuthorityMake us pay down for our offence by weightThe words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.Re-enter LUCIO and two GentlemenLUCIOWhy, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?CLAUDIOFrom too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:As surfeit is the father of much fast,So every scope by the immoderate useTurns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.LUCIOIf could speak so wisely under an arrest, I wouldsend for certain of my creditors: and yet, to saythe truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedomas the morality of imprisonment. What's thyoffence, Claudio?CLAUDIOWhat but to speak of would offend again.LUCIOWhat, is't murder?CLAUDIONo.LUCIOLechery?CLAUDIOCall it so.ProvostAway, sir! you must go.CLAUDIOOne word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.LUCIOA hundred, if they'll do you any good.Is lechery so look'd after?CLAUDIOThus stands it with me: upon a true contractI got possession of Julietta's bed:You know the lady; she is fast my wife,Save that we do the denunciation lackOf outward order: this we came not to,Only for propagation of a dowerRemaining in the coffer of her friends,From whom we thought it meet to hide our loveTill time had made them for us. But it chancesThe stealth of our most mutual entertainmentWith character too gross is writ on Juliet.LUCIOWith child, perhaps?CLAUDIOUnhappily, even so.And the new deputy now for the duke--Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,Or whether that the body public beA horse whereon the governor doth ride,Who, newly in the seat, that it may knowHe can command, lets it straight feel the spur;Whether the tyranny be in his place,Or in his emmence that fills it up,I stagger in:--but this new governorAwakes me all the enrolled penaltiesWhich have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wallSo long that nineteen zodiacs have gone roundAnd none of them been worn; and, for a name,Now puts the drowsy and neglected actFreshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.LUCIOI warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle onthy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal tohim.CLAUDIOI have done so, but he's not to be found.I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:This day my sister should the cloister enterAnd there receive her approbation:Acquaint her with the danger of my state:Implore her, in my voice, that she make friendsTo the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:I have great hope in that; for in her youthThere is a prone and speechless dialect,Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous artWhen she will play with reason and discourse,And well she can persuade.LUCIOI pray she may; as well for the encouragement of thelike, which else would stand under grievousimposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who Iwould be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at agame of tick-tack. I'll to her.CLAUDIOI thank you, good friend Lucio.LUCIOWithin two hours.CLAUDIOCome, officer, away!ExeuntSCENE III. A monastery.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMASDUKE VINCENTIONo, holy father; throw away that thought;Believe not that the dribbling dart of loveCan pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire theeTo give me secret harbour, hath a purposeMore grave and wrinkled than the aims and endsOf burning youth.FRIAR THOMASMay your grace speak of it?DUKE VINCENTIOMy holy sir, none better knows than youHow I have ever loved the life removedAnd held in idle price to haunt assembliesWhere youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,A man of stricture and firm abstinence,My absolute power and place here in Vienna,And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,And so it is received. Now, pious sir,You will demand of me why I do this?FRIAR THOMASGladly, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOWe have strict statutes and most biting laws.The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,Only to stick it in their children's sightFor terror, not to use, in time the rodBecomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;And liberty plucks justice by the nose;The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwartGoes all decorum.FRIAR THOMASIt rested in your graceTo unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:And it in you more dreadful would have seem'dThan in Lord Angelo.DUKE VINCENTIOI do fear, too dreadful:Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall themFor what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,When evil deeds have their permissive passAnd not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,I have on Angelo imposed the office;Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,And yet my nature never in the fightTo do in slander. And to behold his sway,I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,Supply me with the habit and instruct meHow I may formally in person bear meLike a true friar. More reasons for this actionAt our more leisure shall I render you;Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confessesThat his blood flows, or that his appetiteIs more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,If power change purpose, what our seemers be.ExeuntSCENE IV. A nunnery.Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCAISABELLAAnd have you nuns no farther privileges?FRANCISCAAre not these large enough?ISABELLAYes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;But rather wishing a more strict restraintUpon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.LUCIO[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!ISABELLAWho's that which calls?FRANCISCAIt is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,Turn you the key, and know his business of him;You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.When you have vow'd, you must not speak with menBut in the presence of the prioress:Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.He calls again; I pray you, answer him.ExitISABELLAPeace and prosperity! Who is't that callsEnter LUCIOLUCIOHail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-rosesProclaim you are no less! Can you so stead meAs bring me to the sight of Isabella,A novice of this place and the fair sisterTo her unhappy brother Claudio?ISABELLAWhy 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,The rather for I now must make you knowI am that Isabella and his sister.LUCIOGentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.ISABELLAWoe me! for what?LUCIOFor that which, if myself might be his judge,He should receive his punishment in thanks:He hath got his friend with child.ISABELLASir, make me not your story.LUCIOIt is true.I would not--though 'tis my familiar sinWith maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.By your renouncement an immortal spirit,And to be talk'd with in sincerity,As with a saint.ISABELLAYou do blaspheme the good in mocking me.LUCIODo not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:Your brother and his lover have embraced:As those that feed grow full, as blossoming timeThat from the seedness the bare fallow bringsTo teeming foison, even so her plenteous wombExpresseth his full tilth and husbandry.ISABELLASome one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?LUCIOIs she your cousin?ISABELLAAdoptedly; as school-maids change their namesBy vain though apt affection.LUCIOShe it is.ISABELLAO, let him marry her.LUCIOThis is the point.The duke is very strangely gone from hence;Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,In hand and hope of action: but we do learnBy those that know the very nerves of state,His givings-out were of an infinite distanceFrom his true-meant design. Upon his place,And with full line of his authority,Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose bloodIs very snow-broth; one who never feelsThe wanton stings and motions of the sense,But doth rebate and blunt his natural edgeWith profits of the mind, study and fast.He--to give fear to use and liberty,Which have for long run by the hideous law,As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,Under whose heavy sense your brother's lifeFalls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;And follows close the rigour of the statute,To make him an example. All hope is gone,Unless you have the grace by your fair prayerTo soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business'Twixt you and your poor brother.ISABELLADoth he so seek his life?LUCIOHas censured himAlready; and, as I hear, the provost hathA warrant for his execution.ISABELLAAlas! what poor ability's in meTo do him good?LUCIOAssay the power you have.ISABELLAMy power? Alas, I doubt--LUCIOOur doubts are traitorsAnd make us lose the good we oft might winBy fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,All their petitions are as freely theirsAs they themselves would owe them.ISABELLAI'll see what I can do.LUCIOBut speedily.ISABELLAI will about it straight;No longer staying but to give the motherNotice of my affair. I humbly thank you:Commend me to my brother: soon at nightI'll send him certain word of my success.LUCIOI take my leave of you.ISABELLAGood sir, adieu.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behindANGELOWe must not make a scarecrow of the law,Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,And let it keep one shape, till custom make itTheir perch and not their terror.ESCALUSAy, but yetLet us be keen, and rather cut a little,Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentlemanWhom I would save, had a most noble father!Let but your honour know,Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,That, in the working of your own affections,Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,Or that the resolute acting of your bloodCould have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,Whether you had not sometime in your lifeErr'd in this point which now you censure him,And pull'd the law upon you.ANGELO'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,Another thing to fall. I not deny,The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,May in the sworn twelve have a thief or twoGuiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,That justice seizes: what know the lawsThat thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,The jewel that we find, we stoop and take'tBecause we see it; but what we do not seeWe tread upon, and never think of it.You may not so extenuate his offenceFor I have had such faults; but rather tell me,When I, that censure him, do so offend,Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.ESCALUSBe it as your wisdom will.ANGELOWhere is the provost?ProvostHere, if it like your honour.ANGELOSee that ClaudioBe executed by nine to-morrow morning:Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.Exit ProvostESCALUS[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:And some condemned for a fault alone.Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEYELBOWCome, bring them away: if these be good people ina commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses incommon houses, I know no law: bring them away.ANGELOHow now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?ELBOWIf it Please your honour, I am the poor duke'sconstable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean uponjustice, sir, and do bring in here before your goodhonour two notorious benefactors.ANGELOBenefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? arethey not malefactors?ELBOWIf it? please your honour, I know not well what theyare: but precise villains they are, that I am sureof; and void of all profanation in the world thatgood Christians ought to have.ESCALUSThis comes off well; here's a wise officer.ANGELOGo to: what quality are they of? Elbow is yourname? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?POMPEYHe cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.ANGELOWhat are you, sir?ELBOWHe, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one thatserves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as theysay, plucked down in the suburbs; and now sheprofesses a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.ESCALUSHow know you that?ELBOWMy wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--ESCALUSHow? thy wife?ELBOWAy, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--ESCALUSDost thou detest her therefore?ELBOWI say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well asshe, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.ESCALUSHow dost thou know that, constable?ELBOWMarry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a womancardinally given, might have been accused infornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.ESCALUSBy the woman's means?ELBOWAy, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as shespit in his face, so she defied him.POMPEYSir, if it please your honour, this is not so.ELBOWProve it before these varlets here, thou honourableman; prove it.ESCALUSDo you hear how he misplaces?POMPEYSir, she came in great with child; and longing,saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;sir, we had but two in the house, which at that verydistant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, adish of some three-pence; your honours have seensuch dishes; they are not China dishes, but verygood dishes,--ESCALUSGo to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.POMPEYNo, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein inthe right: but to the point. As I say, thisMistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, andbeing great-bellied, and longing, as I said, forprunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten therest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them veryhonestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I couldnot give you three-pence again.FROTHNo, indeed.POMPEYVery well: you being then, if you be remembered,cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--FROTHAy, so I did indeed.POMPEYWhy, very well; I telling you then, if you beremembered, that such a one and such a one were pastcure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept verygood diet, as I told you,--FROTHAll this is true.POMPEYWhy, very well, then,--ESCALUSCome, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. Whatwas done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause tocomplain of? Come me to what was done to her.POMPEYSir, your honour cannot come to that yet.ESCALUSNo, sir, nor I mean it not.POMPEYSir, but you shall come to it, by your honour'sleave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Frothhere, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whosefather died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,Master Froth?FROTHAll-hallond eve.POMPEYWhy, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas inthe Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delightto sit, have you not?FROTHI have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.POMPEYWhy, very well, then; I hope here be truths.ANGELOThis will last out a night in Russia,When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.And leave you to the hearing of the cause;Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.ESCALUSI think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.Exit ANGELONow, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?POMPEYOnce, sir? there was nothing done to her once.ELBOWI beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.POMPEYI beseech your honour, ask me.ESCALUSWell, sir; what did this gentleman to her?POMPEYI beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for agood purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?ESCALUSAy, sir, very well.POMPEYNay; I beseech you, mark it well.ESCALUSWell, I do so.POMPEYDoth your honour see any harm in his face?ESCALUSWhy, no.POMPEYI'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worstthing about him. Good, then; if his face be theworst thing about him, how could Master Froth do theconstable's wife any harm? I would know that ofyour honour.ESCALUSHe's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?ELBOWFirst, an it like you, the house is a respectedhouse; next, this is a respected fellow; and hismistress is a respected woman.POMPEYBy this hand, sir, his wife is a more respectedperson than any of us all.ELBOWVarlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! thetime has yet to come that she was ever respectedwith man, woman, or child.POMPEYSir, she was respected with him before he married with her.ESCALUSWhich is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Isthis true?ELBOWO thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wickedHannibal! I respected with her before I was marriedto her! If ever I was respected with her, or shewith me, let not your worship think me the poorduke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, orI'll have mine action of battery on thee.ESCALUSIf he took you a box o' the ear, you might have youraction of slander too.ELBOWMarry, I thank your good worship for it. What is'tyour worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?ESCALUSTruly, officer, because he hath some offences in himthat thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let himcontinue in his courses till thou knowest what theyare.ELBOWMarry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thouwicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou artto continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.ESCALUSWhere were you born, friend?FROTHHere in Vienna, sir.ESCALUSAre you of fourscore pounds a year?FROTHYes, an't please you, sir.ESCALUSSo. What trade are you of, sir?POMPHEYTapster; a poor widow's tapster.ESCALUSYour mistress' name?POMPHEYMistress Overdone.ESCALUSHath she had any more than one husband?POMPEYNine, sir; Overdone by the last.ESCALUSNine!

What's yourname, Master tapster?POMPEYPompey.ESCALUSWhat else?POMPEYBum, sir.ESCALUSTroth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey theGreat. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are younot? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.POMPEYTruly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.ESCALUSHow would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? Whatdo you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?POMPEYIf the law would allow it, sir.ESCALUSBut the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shallnot be allowed in Vienna.POMPEYDoes your worship mean to geld and splay all theyouth of the city?ESCALUSNo, Pompey.POMPEYTruly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.If your worship will take order for the drabs andthe knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.ESCALUSThere are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:it is but heading and hanging.POMPEYIf you head and hang all that offend that way butfor ten year together, you'll be glad to give out acommission for more heads: if this law hold inVienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in itafter three-pence a bay: if you live to see thiscome to pass, say Pompey told you so.ESCALUSThank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of yourprophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not findyou before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewdCaesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shallhave you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.POMPEYI thank your worship for your good counsel:Asidebut I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shallbetter determine.Whip me?

You say, seven years together?ELBOWAnd a half, sir.ESCALUSAlas, it hath been great pains to you. They do youwrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not menin your ward sufficient to serve it?ELBOWFaith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as theyare chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; Ido it for some piece of money, and go through withall.ESCALUSLook you bring me in the names of some six or seven,the most sufficient of your parish.ELBOWTo your worship's house, sir?ESCALUSTo my house. Fare you well.Exit ELBOWWhat's o'clock, think you?JusticeEleven, sir.ESCALUSI pray you home to dinner with me.JusticeI humbly thank you.ESCALUSIt grieves me for the death of Claudio;But there's no remedy.JusticeLord Angelo is severe.ESCALUSIt is but needful:Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:But yet,--poor Claudio!

Provost?ProvostIs it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?ANGELODid not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?Why dost thou ask again?ProvostLest I might be too rash:Under your good correction, I have seen,When, after execution, judgment hathRepented o'er his doom.ANGELOGo to; let that be mine:Do you your office, or give up your place,And you shall well be spared.ProvostI crave your honour's pardon.What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?She's very near her hour.ANGELODispose of herTo some more fitter place, and that with speed.Re-enter ServantServantHere is the sister of the man condemn'dDesires access to you.ANGELOHath he a sister?ProvostAy, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,And to be shortly of a sisterhood,If not already.ANGELOWell, let her be admitted.Exit ServantSee you the fornicatress be removed:Let have needful, but not lavish, means;There shall be order for't.Enter ISABELLA and LUCIOProvostGod save your honour!ANGELOStay a little while.To ISABELLAYou're welcome: what's your will?ISABELLAI am a woeful suitor to your honour,Please but your honour hear me.ANGELOWell; what's your suit?ISABELLAThere is a vice that most I do abhor,And most desire should meet the blow of justice;For which I would not plead, but that I must;For which I must not plead, but that I amAt war 'twixt will and will not.ANGELOWell; the matter?ISABELLAI have a brother is condemn'd to die:I do beseech you, let it be his fault,And not my brother.Provost[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!ANGELOCondemn the fault and not the actor of it?Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:Mine were the very cipher of a function,To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,And let go by the actor.ISABELLAO just but severe law!I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to himagain, entreat him;Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:You are too cold; if you should need a pin,You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:To him, I say!ISABELLAMust he needs die?ANGELOMaiden, no remedy.ISABELLAYes; I do think that you might pardon him,And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.ANGELOI will not do't.ISABELLABut can you, if you would?ANGELOLook, what I will not, that I cannot do.ISABELLABut might you do't, and do the world no wrong,If so your heart were touch'd with that remorseA s mine is to him?ANGELOHe's sentenced; 'tis too late.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.ISABELLAToo late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.May call it back again. Well, believe this,No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,Become them with one half so good a graceAs mercy does.If he had been as you and you as he,You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,Would not have been so stern.ANGELOPray you, be gone.ISABELLAI would to heaven I had your potency,And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,And what a prisoner.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]Ay, touch him; there's the vein.ANGELOYour brother is a forfeit of the law,And you but waste your words.ISABELLAAlas, alas!Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;And He that might the vantage best have tookFound out the remedy. How would you be,If He, which is the top of judgment, shouldBut judge you as you are? O, think on that;And mercy then will breathe within your lips,Like man new made.ANGELOBe you content, fair maid;It is the law, not I condemn your brother:Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.ISABELLATo-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchensWe kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heavenWith less respect than we do ministerTo our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;Who is it that hath died for this offence?There's many have committed it.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.ANGELOThe law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:Those many had not dared to do that evil,If the first that did the edict infringeHad answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awakeTakes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,Are now to have no successive degrees,But, ere they live, to end.ISABELLAYet show some pity.ANGELOI show it most of all when I show justice;For then I pity those I do not know,Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.ISABELLASo you must be the first that gives this sentence,And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellentTo have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannousTo use it like a giant.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.ISABELLACould great men thunderAs Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,For every pelting, petty officerWould use his heaven for thunder;Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous boltSplit'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oakThan the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,Drest in a little brief authority,Most ignorant of what he's most assured,His glassy essence, like an angry ape,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heavenAs make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,Would all themselves laugh mortal.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! hewill relent;He's coming; I perceive 't.Provost[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!ISABELLAWe cannot weigh our brother with ourself:Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,But in the less foul profanation.LUCIOThou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.ISABELLAThat in the captain's but a choleric word,Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.ANGELOWhy do you put these sayings upon me?ISABELLABecause authority, though it err like others,Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth knowThat's like my brother's fault: if it confessA natural guiltiness such as is his,Let it not sound a thought upon your tongueAgainst my brother's life.ANGELO[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tisSuch sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.ISABELLAGentle my lord, turn back.ANGELOI will bethink me: come again tomorrow.ISABELLAHark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.ANGELOHow! bribe me?ISABELLAAy, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.ISABELLANot with fond shekels of the tested gold,Or stones whose rates are either rich or poorAs fancy values them; but with true prayersThat shall be up at heaven and enter thereEre sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,From fasting maids whose minds are dedicateTo nothing temporal.ANGELOWell; come to me to-morrow.LUCIO[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!ISABELLAHeaven keep your honour safe!ANGELO[Aside]	Amen:For I am that way going to temptation,Where prayers cross.ISABELLAAt what hour to-morrowShall I attend your lordship?ANGELOAt any time 'fore noon.ISABELLA'Save your honour!Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and ProvostANGELOFrom thee, even from thy virtue!What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?Ha!Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is IThat, lying by the violet in the sun,Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it beThat modesty may more betray our senseThan woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,Shall we desire to raze the sanctuaryAnd pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?Dost thou desire her foully for those thingsThat make her good? O, let her brother live!Thieves for their robbery have authorityWhen judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,That I desire to hear her speak again,And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerousIs that temptation that doth goad us onTo sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,With all her double vigour, art and nature,Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maidSubdues me quite. Even till now,When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.ExitSCENE III. A room in a prison.Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and ProvostDUKE VINCENTIOHail to you, provost! so I think you are.ProvostI am the provost. What's your will, good friar?DUKE VINCENTIOBound by my charity and my blest order,I come to visit the afflicted spiritsHere in the prison. Do me the common rightTo let me see them and to make me knowThe nature of their crimes, that I may ministerTo them accordingly.ProvostI would do more than that, if more were needful.Enter JULIETLook, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;And he that got it, sentenced; a young manMore fit to do another such offenceThan die for this.DUKE VINCENTIOWhen must he die?ProvostAs I do think, to-morrow.I have provided for you: stay awhile,To JULIETAnd you shall be conducted.DUKE VINCENTIORepent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?JULIETI do; and bear the shame most patiently.DUKE VINCENTIOI'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,And try your penitence, if it be sound,Or hollowly put on.JULIETI'll gladly learn.DUKE VINCENTIOLove you the man that wrong'd you?JULIETYes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.DUKE VINCENTIOSo then it seems your most offenceful actWas mutually committed?JULIETMutually.DUKE VINCENTIOThen was your sin of heavier kind than his.JULIETI do confess it, and repent it, father.DUKE VINCENTIO'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,But as we stand in fear,--JULIETI do repent me, as it is an evil,And take the shame with joy.DUKE VINCENTIOThere rest.Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,And I am going with instruction to him.Grace go with you, Benedicite!ExitJULIETMust die to-morrow! O injurious love,That respites me a life, whose very comfortIs still a dying horror!Provost'Tis pity of him.ExeuntSCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.Enter ANGELOANGELOWhen I would pray and think, I think and prayTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,As if I did but only chew his name;And in my heart the strong and swelling evilOf my conception. The state, whereon I studiedIs like a good thing, being often read,Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,Could I with boot change for an idle plume,Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:'Tis not the devil's crest.Enter a ServantHow now! who's there?ServantOne Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.ANGELOTeach her the way.Exit ServantO heavens!Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,Making both it unable for itself,And dispossessing all my other partsOf necessary fitness?So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;Come all to help him, and so stop the airBy which he should revive: and even soThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondnessCrowd to his presence, where their untaught loveMust needs appear offence.Enter ISABELLAHow now, fair maid?ISABELLAI am come to know your pleasure.ANGELOThat you might know it, would much better please meThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.ISABELLAEven so. Heaven keep your honour!ANGELOYet may he live awhile; and, it may be,As long as you or Iyet he must die.ISABELLAUnder your sentence?ANGELOYea.ISABELLAWhen, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,Longer or shorter, he may be so fittedThat his soul sicken not.ANGELOHa! fie, these filthy vices! It were as goodTo pardon him that hath from nature stolenA man already made, as to remitTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's imageIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easyFalsely to take away a life true madeAs to put metal in restrained meansTo make a false one.ISABELLA'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.ANGELOSay you so? then I shall pose you quickly.Which had you rather, that the most just lawNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,Give up your body to such sweet uncleannessAs she that he hath stain'd?ISABELLASir, believe this,I had rather give my body than my soul.ANGELOI talk not of your soul: our compell'd sinsStand more for number than for accompt.ISABELLAHow say you?ANGELONay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speakAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:I, now the voice of the recorded law,Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:Might there not be a charity in sinTo save this brother's life?ISABELLAPlease you to do't,I'll take it as a peril to my soul,It is no sin at all, but charity.ANGELOPleased you to do't at peril of your soul,Were equal poise of sin and charity.ISABELLAThat I do beg his life, if it be sin,Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayerTo have it added to the faults of mine,And nothing of your answer.ANGELONay, but hear me.Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.ISABELLALet me be ignorant, and in nothing good,But graciously to know I am no better.ANGELOThus wisdom wishes to appear most brightWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masksProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:Your brother is to die.ISABELLASo.ANGELOAnd his offence is so, as it appears,Accountant to the law upon that pain.ISABELLATrue.ANGELOAdmit no other way to save his life,--As I subscribe not that, nor any other,But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,Finding yourself desired of such a person,Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,Could fetch your brother from the manaclesOf the all-building law; and that there wereNo earthly mean to save him, but that eitherYou must lay down the treasures of your bodyTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;What would you do?ISABELLAAs much for my poor brother as myself:That is, were I under the terms of death,The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,And strip myself to death, as to a bedThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yieldMy body up to shame.ANGELOThen must your brother die.ISABELLAAnd 'twere the cheaper way:Better it were a brother died at once,Than that a sister, by redeeming him,Should die for ever.ANGELOWere not you then as cruel as the sentenceThat you have slander'd so?ISABELLAIgnomy in ransom and free pardonAre of two houses: lawful mercyIs nothing kin to foul redemption.ANGELOYou seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;And rather proved the sliding of your brotherA merriment than a vice.ISABELLAO, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:I something do excuse the thing I hate,For his advantage that I dearly love.ANGELOWe are all frail.ISABELLAElse let my brother die,If not a feodary, but only heOwe and succeed thy weakness.ANGELONay, women are frail too.ISABELLAAy, as the glasses where they view themselves;Which are as easy broke as they make forms.Women! Help Heaven! men their creation marIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;For we are soft as our complexions are,And credulous to false prints.ANGELOI think it well:And from this testimony of your own sex,--Since I suppose we are made to be no strongerThan faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;I do arrest your words. Be that you are,That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;If you be one, as you are well express'dBy all external warrants, show it now,By putting on the destined livery.ISABELLAI have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,Let me entreat you speak the former language.ANGELOPlainly conceive, I love you.ISABELLAMy brother did love Juliet,And you tell me that he shall die for it.ANGELOHe shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.ISABELLAI know your virtue hath a licence in't,Which seems a little fouler than it is,To pluck on others.ANGELOBelieve me, on mine honour,My words express my purpose.ISABELLAHa! little honour to be much believed,And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:Sign me a present pardon for my brother,Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloudWhat man thou art.ANGELOWho will believe thee, Isabel?My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,Will so your accusation overweigh,That you shall stifle in your own reportAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,And now I give my sensual race the rein:Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brotherBy yielding up thy body to my will;Or else he must not only die the death,But thy unkindness shall his death draw outTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,Or, by the affection that now guides me most,I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.ExitISABELLATo whom should I complain? Did I tell this,Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,Either of condemnation or approof;Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.That, had he twenty heads to tender downOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,Before his sister should her body stoopTo such abhorr'd pollution.Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:More than our brother is our chastity.I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.ExitACT IIISCENE I. A room in the prison.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and ProvostDUKE VINCENTIOSo then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?CLAUDIOThe miserable have no other medicineBut only hope:I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.DUKE VINCENTIOBe absolute for death; either death or lifeShall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:If I do lose thee, I do lose a thingThat none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,Servile to all the skyey influences,That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shunAnd yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;For all the accommodations that thou bear'stAre nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;For thou dost fear the soft and tender forkOf a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'stThy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;For thou exist'st on many a thousand grainsThat issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,The mere effusion of thy proper loins,Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youthBecomes as aged, and doth beg the almsOf palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in thisThat bears the name of life? Yet in this lifeLie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,That makes these odds all even.CLAUDIOI humbly thank you.To sue to live, I find I seek to die;And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.ISABELLA[Within]  What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!ProvostWho's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.DUKE VINCENTIODear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.CLAUDIOMost holy sir, I thank you.Enter ISABELLAISABELLAMy business is a word or two with Claudio.ProvostAnd very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.DUKE VINCENTIOProvost, a word with you.ProvostAs many as you please.DUKE VINCENTIOBring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and ProvostCLAUDIONow, sister, what's the comfort?ISABELLAWhy,As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,Intends you for his swift ambassador,Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:Therefore your best appointment make with speed;To-morrow you set on.CLAUDIOIs there no remedy?ISABELLANone, but such remedy as, to save a head,To cleave a heart in twain.CLAUDIOBut is there any?ISABELLAYes, brother, you may live:There is a devilish mercy in the judge,If you'll implore it, that will free your life,But fetter you till death.CLAUDIOPerpetual durance?ISABELLAAy, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,Though all the world's vastidity you had,To a determined scope.CLAUDIOBut in what nature?ISABELLAIn such a one as, you consenting to't,Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,And leave you naked.CLAUDIOLet me know the point.ISABELLAO, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,And six or seven winters more respectThan a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?The sense of death is most in apprehension;And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,In corporal sufferance finds a pang as greatAs when a giant dies.CLAUDIOWhy give you me this shame?Think you I can a resolution fetchFrom flowery tenderness? If I must die,I will encounter darkness as a bride,And hug it in mine arms.ISABELLAThere spake my brother; there my father's graveDid utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:Thou art too noble to conserve a lifeIn base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,Whose settled visage and deliberate wordNips youth i' the head and follies doth emmewAs falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devilHis filth within being cast, he would appearA pond as deep as hell.CLAUDIOThe prenzie Angelo!ISABELLAO, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,The damned'st body to invest and coverIn prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?If I would yield him my virginity,Thou mightst be freed.CLAUDIOO heavens! it cannot be.ISABELLAYes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,So to offend him still. This night's the timeThat I should do what I abhor to name,Or else thou diest to-morrow.CLAUDIOThou shalt not do't.ISABELLAO, were it but my life,I'ld throw it down for your deliveranceAs frankly as a pin.CLAUDIOThanks, dear Isabel.ISABELLABe ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.CLAUDIOYes. Has he affections in him,That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.ISABELLAWhich is the least?CLAUDIOIf it were damnable, he being so wise,Why would he for the momentary trickBe perdurably fined? O Isabel!ISABELLAWhat says my brother?CLAUDIODeath is a fearful thing.ISABELLAAnd shamed life a hateful.CLAUDIOAy, but to die, and go we know not where;To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;This sensible warm motion to becomeA kneaded clod; and the delighted spiritTo bathe in fiery floods, or to resideIn thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,And blown with restless violence round aboutThe pendent world; or to be worse than worstOf those that lawless and incertain thoughtImagine howling: 'tis too horrible!The weariest and most loathed worldly lifeThat age, ache, penury and imprisonmentCan lay on nature is a paradiseTo what we fear of death.ISABELLAAlas, alas!CLAUDIOSweet sister, let me live:What sin you do to save a brother's life,Nature dispenses with the deed so farThat it becomes a virtue.ISABELLAO you beast!O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?Is't not a kind of incest, to take lifeFrom thine own sister's shame? What should I think?Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!For such a warped slip of wildernessNe'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!Die, perish! Might but my bending downReprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,No word to save thee.CLAUDIONay, hear me, Isabel.ISABELLAO, fie, fie, fie!Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:'Tis best thou diest quickly.CLAUDIOO hear me, Isabella!Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIODUKE VINCENTIOVouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.ISABELLAWhat is your will?DUKE VINCENTIOMight you dispense with your leisure, I would by andby have some speech with you: the satisfaction Iwould require is likewise your own benefit.ISABELLAI have no superfluous leisure; my stay must bestolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.Walks apartDUKE VINCENTIOSon, I have overheard what hath passed between youand your sister. Angelo had never the purpose tocorrupt her; only he hath made an essay of hervirtue to practise his judgment with the dispositionof natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,hath made him that gracious denial which he is mostglad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and Iknow this to be true; therefore prepare yourself todeath: do not satisfy your resolution with hopesthat are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go toyour knees and make ready.CLAUDIOLet me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of lovewith life that I will sue to be rid of it.DUKE VINCENTIOHold you there: farewell.Exit CLAUDIOProvost, a word with you!Re-enter ProvostProvostWhat's your will, fatherDUKE VINCENTIOThat now you are come, you will be gone. Leave meawhile with the maid: my mind promises with myhabit no loss shall touch her by my company.ProvostIn good time.Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forwardDUKE VINCENTIOThe hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beautybrief in goodness; but grace, being the soul ofyour complexion, shall keep the body of it everfair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, butthat frailty hath examples for his falling, I shouldwonder at Angelo. How will you do to content thissubstitute, and to save your brother?ISABELLAI am now going to resolve him: I had rather mybrother die by the law than my son should beunlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good dukedeceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I canspeak to him, I will open my lips in vain, ordiscover his government.DUKE VINCENTIOThat shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matternow stands, he will avoid your accusation; he madetrial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on myadvisings: to the love I have in doing good aremedy presents itself. I do make myself believethat you may most uprighteously do a poor wrongedlady a merited benefit; redeem your brother fromthe angry law; do no stain to your own graciousperson; and much please the absent duke, ifperadventure he shall ever return to have hearing ofthis business.ISABELLALet me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to doanything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.DUKE VINCENTIOVirtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Haveyou not heard speak of Mariana, the sister ofFrederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?ISABELLAI have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.DUKE VINCENTIOShe should this Angelo have married; was affiancedto her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: betweenwhich time of the contract and limit of thesolemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,having in that perished vessel the dowry of hissister. But mark how heavily this befell to thepoor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble andrenowned brother, in his love toward her ever mostkind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew ofher fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, hercombinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.ISABELLACan this be so? did Angelo so leave her?DUKE VINCENTIOLeft her in her tears, and dried not one of themwith his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yetwears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,is washed with them, but relents not.ISABELLAWhat a merit were it in death to take this poor maidfrom the world! What corruption in this life, thatit will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?DUKE VINCENTIOIt is a rupture that you may easily heal: and thecure of it not only saves your brother, but keepsyou from dishonour in doing it.ISABELLAShow me how, good father.DUKE VINCENTIOThis forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuanceof her first affection: his unjust unkindness, thatin all reason should have quenched her love, hath,like an impediment in the current, made it moreviolent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer hisrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree withhis demands to the point; only refer yourself tothis advantage, first, that your stay with him maynot be long; that the time may have all shadow andsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.This being granted in course,--and now followsall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead upyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounteracknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him toher recompense: and here, by this, is your brothersaved, your honour untainted, the poor Marianaadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maidwill I frame and make fit for his attempt. If youthink well to carry this as you may, the doublenessof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.What think you of it?ISABELLAThe image of it gives me content already; and Itrust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.DUKE VINCENTIOIt lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedilyto Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to hisbed, give him promise of satisfaction. I willpresently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moatedgrange, resides this dejected Mariana. At thatplace call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, thatit may be quickly.ISABELLAI thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.Exeunt severallySCENE II. The street before the prison.Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEYELBOWNay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you willneeds buy and sell men and women like beasts, weshall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.DUKE VINCENTIOO heavens! what stuff is herePOMPEY'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, themerriest was put down, and the worser allowed byorder of law a furred gown to keep him warm; andfurred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, thatcraft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.ELBOWCome your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.DUKE VINCENTIOAnd you, good brother father. What offence haththis man made you, sir?ELBOWMarry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, wetake him to be a thief too, sir; for we have foundupon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we havesent to the deputy.DUKE VINCENTIOFie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!The evil that thou causest to be done,That is thy means to live. Do thou but thinkWhat 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a backFrom such a filthy vice: say to thyself,From their abominable and beastly touchesI drink, I eat, array myself, and live.Canst thou believe thy living is a life,So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.POMPEYIndeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,sir, I would prove--DUKE VINCENTIONay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:Correction and instruction must both workEre this rude beast will profit.ELBOWHe must before the deputy, sir; he has given himwarning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: ifhe be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he wereas good go a mile on his errand.DUKE VINCENTIOThat we were all, as some would seem to be,From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!ELBOWHis neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.POMPEYI spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and afriend of mine.Enter LUCIOLUCIOHow now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels ofCaesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is therenone of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to behad now, for putting the hand in the pocket andextracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? Whatsayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is'tnot drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayestthou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which isthe way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? Thetrick of it?DUKE VINCENTIOStill thus, and thus; still worse!LUCIOHow doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures shestill, ha?POMPEYTroth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and sheis herself in the tub.LUCIOWhy, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must beso: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art goingto prison, Pompey?POMPEYYes, faith, sir.LUCIOWhy, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say Isent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?ELBOWFor being a bawd, for being a bawd.LUCIOWell, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be thedue of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is hedoubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; youwill keep the house.POMPEYI hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.LUCIONo, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: Ifyou take it not patiently, why, your mettle is themore. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.DUKE VINCENTIOAnd you.LUCIODoes Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?ELBOWCome your ways, sir; come.POMPEYYou will not bail me, then, sir?LUCIOThen, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?what news?ELBOWCome your ways, sir; come.LUCIOGo to kennel, Pompey; go.Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and OfficersWhat news, friar, of the duke?DUKE VINCENTIOI know none. Can you tell me of any?LUCIOSome say he is with the Emperor of Russia; othersome, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?DUKE VINCENTIOI know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.LUCIOIt was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal fromthe state, and usurp the beggary he was never bornto. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; heputs transgression to 't.DUKE VINCENTIOHe does well in 't.LUCIOA little more lenity to lechery would do no harm inhim: something too crabbed that way, friar.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.LUCIOYes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirpit quite, friar, till eating and drinking be putdown. They say this Angelo was not made by man andwoman after this downright way of creation: is ittrue, think you?DUKE VINCENTIOHow should he be made, then?LUCIOSome report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that hewas begot between two stock-fishes. But it iscertain that when he makes water his urine iscongealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is amotion generative; that's infallible.DUKE VINCENTIOYou are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.LUCIOWhy, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for therebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of aman! Would the duke that is absent have done this?Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting ahundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursinga thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: heknew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.DUKE VINCENTIOI never heard the absent duke much detected forwomen; he was not inclined that way.LUCIOO, sir, you are deceived.DUKE VINCENTIO'Tis not possible.LUCIOWho, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; andhis use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: theduke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;that let me inform you.DUKE VINCENTIOYou do him wrong, surely.LUCIOSir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was theduke: and I believe I know the cause of hiswithdrawing.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat, I prithee, might be the cause?LUCIONo, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within theteeth and the lips: but this I can let youunderstand, the greater file of the subject held theduke to be wise.DUKE VINCENTIOWise! why, no question but he was.LUCIOA very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.DUKE VINCENTIOEither this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:the very stream of his life and the business he hathhelmed must upon a warranted need give him a betterproclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his ownbringings-forth, and he shall appear to theenvious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if yourknowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.LUCIOSir, I know him, and I love him.DUKE VINCENTIOLove talks with better knowledge, and knowledge withdearer love.LUCIOCome, sir, I know what I know.DUKE VINCENTIOI can hardly believe that, since you know not whatyou speak. But, if ever the duke return, as ourprayers are he may, let me desire you to make youranswer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to callupon you; and, I pray you, your name?LUCIOSir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.DUKE VINCENTIOHe shall know you better, sir, if I may live toreport you.LUCIOI fear you not.DUKE VINCENTIOO, you hope the duke will return no more; or youimagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed Ican do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.LUCIOI'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell ifClaudio die to-morrow or no?DUKE VINCENTIOWhy should he die, sir?LUCIOWhy? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I wouldthe duke we talk of were returned again: theungenitured agent will unpeople the province withcontinency; sparrows must not build in hishouse-eaves, because they are lecherous. The dukeyet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he wouldnever bring them to light: would he were returned!Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. Theduke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton onFridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brownbread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.ExitDUKE VINCENTIONo might nor greatness in mortalityCan censure 'scape; back-wounding calumnyThe whitest virtue strikes. What king so strongCan tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?But who comes here?Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONEESCALUSGo; away with her to prison!MISTRESS OVERDONEGood my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounteda merciful man; good my lord.ESCALUSDouble and treble admonition, and still forfeit inthe same kind! This would make mercy swear and playthe tyrant.ProvostA bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it pleaseyour honour.MISTRESS OVERDONEMy lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in theduke's time; he promised her marriage: his childis a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!ESCALUSThat fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him becalled before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;no more words.Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONEProvost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnishedwith divines, and have all charitable preparation.if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not beso with him.ProvostSo please you, this friar hath been with him, andadvised him for the entertainment of death.ESCALUSGood even, good father.DUKE VINCENTIOBliss and goodness on you!ESCALUSOf whence are you?DUKE VINCENTIONot of this country, though my chance is nowTo use it for my time: I am a brotherOf gracious order, late come from the SeeIn special business from his holiness.ESCALUSWhat news abroad i' the world?DUKE VINCENTIONone, but that there is so great a fever ongoodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerousto be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuousto be constant in any undertaking. There is scarcetruth enough alive to make societies secure; butsecurity enough to make fellowships accurst: muchupon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. Thisnews is old enough, yet it is every day's news. Ipray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?ESCALUSOne that, above all other strifes, contendedespecially to know himself.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat pleasure was he given to?ESCALUSRather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry atany thing which professed to make him rejoice: agentleman of all temperance. But leave we him tohis events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;and let me desire to know how you find Claudioprepared. I am made to understand that you havelent him visitation.DUKE VINCENTIOHe professes to have received no sinister measurefrom his judge, but most willingly humbles himselfto the determination of justice: yet had he framedto himself, by the instruction of his frailty, manydeceiving promises of life; which I by my goodleisure have discredited to him, and now is heresolved to die.ESCALUSYou have paid the heavens your function, and theprisoner the very debt of your calling. I havelaboured for the poor gentleman to the extremestshore of my modesty: but my brother justice have Ifound so severe, that he hath forced me to tell himhe is indeed Justice.DUKE VINCENTIOIf his own life answer the straitness of hisproceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if hechance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.ESCALUSI am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.DUKE VINCENTIOPeace be with you!Exeunt ESCALUS and ProvostHe who the sword of heaven will bearShould be as holy as severe;Pattern in himself to know,Grace to stand, and virtue go;More nor less to others payingThan by self-offences weighing.Shame to him whose cruel strikingKills for faults of his own liking!Twice treble shame on Angelo,To weed my vice and let his grow!O, what may man within him hide,Though angel on the outward side!How may likeness made in crimes,Making practise on the times,To draw with idle spiders' stringsMost ponderous and substantial things!Craft against vice I must apply:With Angelo to-night shall lieHis old betrothed but despised;So disguise shall, by the disguised,Pay with falsehood false exacting,And perform an old contracting.ExitACT IVSCENE I.

Can you cut off a man's head?POMPEYIf the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be amarried man, he's his wife's head, and I can nevercut off a woman's head.ProvostCome, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me adirect answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudioand Barnardine. Here is in our prison a commonexecutioner, who in his office lacks a helper: ifyou will take it on you to assist him, it shallredeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall haveyour full time of imprisonment and your deliverancewith an unpitied whipping, for you have been anotorious bawd.POMPEYSir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. Iwould be glad to receive some instruction from myfellow partner.ProvostWhat, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?Enter ABHORSONABHORSONDo you call, sir?ProvostSirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow inyour execution. If you think it meet, compound withhim by the year, and let him abide here with you; ifnot, use him for the present and dismiss him. Hecannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.ABHORSONA bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.ProvostGo to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turnthe scale.ExitPOMPEYPray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, agood favour you have, but that you have a hanginglook,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?ABHORSONAy, sir; a mysteryPOMPEYPainting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; andyour whores, sir, being members of my occupation,using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:but what mystery there should be in hanging, if Ishould be hanged, I cannot imagine.ABHORSONSir, it is a mystery.POMPEYProof?ABHORSONEvery true man's apparel fits your thief: if it betoo little for your thief, your true man thinks itbig enough; if it be too big for your thief, yourthief thinks it little enough: so every true man'sapparel fits your thief.Re-enter ProvostProvostAre you agreed?POMPEYSir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman isa more penitent trade than your bawd; he dothoftener ask forgiveness.ProvostYou, sirrah, provide your block and your axeto-morrow four o'clock.ABHORSONCome on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.POMPEYI do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you haveoccasion to use me for your own turn, you shall findme yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe youa good turn.ProvostCall hither Barnardine and Claudio:Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSONThe one has my pity; not a jot the other,Being a murderer, though he were my brother.Enter CLAUDIOLook, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrowThou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?CLAUDIOAs fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labourWhen it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:He will not wake.ProvostWho can do good on him?Well, go, prepare yourself.Knocking withinBut, hark, what noise?Heaven give your spirits comfort!Exit CLAUDIOBy and by.I hope it is some pardon or reprieveFor the most gentle Claudio.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as beforeWelcome father.DUKE VINCENTIOThe best and wholesomest spirts of the nightEnvelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?ProvostNone, since the curfew rung.DUKE VINCENTIONot Isabel?ProvostNo.DUKE VINCENTIOThey will, then, ere't be long.ProvostWhat comfort is for Claudio?DUKE VINCENTIOThere's some in hope.ProvostIt is a bitter deputy.DUKE VINCENTIONot so, not so; his life is parallel'dEven with the stroke and line of his great justice:He doth with holy abstinence subdueThat in himself which he spurs on his powerTo qualify in others: were he meal'd with thatWhich he corrects, then were he tyrannous;But this being so, he's just.Knocking withinNow are they come.Exit ProvostThis is a gentle provost: seldom whenThe steeled gaoler is the friend of men.Knocking withinHow now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with hasteThat wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.Re-enter ProvostProvostThere he must stay until the officerArise to let him in: he is call'd up.DUKE VINCENTIOHave you no countermand for Claudio yet,But he must die to-morrow?ProvostNone, sir, none.DUKE VINCENTIOAs near the dawning, provost, as it is,You shall hear more ere morning.ProvostHappilyYou something know; yet I believe there comesNo countermand; no such example have we:Besides, upon the very siege of justiceLord Angelo hath to the public earProfess'd the contrary.Enter a MessengerThis is his lordship's man.DUKE VINCENTIOAnd here comes Claudio's pardon.Messenger[Giving a paper]My lord hath sent you this note; and by me thisfurther charge, that you swerve not from thesmallest article of it, neither in time, matter, orother circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,it is almost day.ProvostI shall obey him.Exit MessengerDUKE VINCENTIO[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sinFor which the pardoner himself is in.Hence hath offence his quick celerity,When it is born in high authority:When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,That for the fault's love is the offender friended.Now, sir, what news?ProvostI told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remissin mine office, awakens me with this unwontedputting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.DUKE VINCENTIOPray you, let's hear.Provost[Reads]'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, letClaudio be executed by four of the clock; and in theafternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Letthis be duly performed; with a thought that moredepends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus failnot to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'What say you to this, sir?DUKE VINCENTIOWhat is that Barnardine who is to be executed in theafternoon?ProvostA Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; onethat is a prisoner nine years old.DUKE VINCENTIOHow came it that the absent duke had not eitherdelivered him to his liberty or executed him? Ihave heard it was ever his manner to do so.ProvostHis friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,indeed, his fact, till now in the government of LordAngelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is now apparent?ProvostMost manifest, and not denied by himself.DUKE VINCENTIOHath he born himself penitently in prison? howseems he to be touched?ProvostA man that apprehends death no more dreadfully butas a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearlessof what's past, present, or to come; insensible ofmortality, and desperately mortal.DUKE VINCENTIOHe wants advice.ProvostHe will hear none: he hath evermore had the libertyof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, hewould not: drunk many times a day, if not many daysentirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as ifto carry him to execution, and showed him a seemingwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.DUKE VINCENTIOMore of him anon. There is written in your brow,provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it nottruly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in theboldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, isno greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hathsentenced him. To make you understand this in amanifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;for the which you are to do me both a present and adangerous courtesy.ProvostPray, sir, in what?DUKE VINCENTIOIn the delaying death.ProvostA lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,and an express command, under penalty, to deliverhis head in the view of Angelo? I may make my caseas Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.DUKE VINCENTIOBy the vow of mine order I warrant you, if myinstructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardinebe this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.ProvostAngelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.DUKE VINCENTIOO, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it wasthe desire of the penitent to be so bared before hisdeath: you know the course is common. If any thingfall to you upon this, more than thanks and goodfortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will pleadagainst it with my life.ProvostPardon me, good father; it is against my oath.DUKE VINCENTIOWere you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?ProvostTo him, and to his substitutes.DUKE VINCENTIOYou will think you have made no offence, if the dukeavouch the justice of your dealing?ProvostBut what likelihood is in that?DUKE VINCENTIONot a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I seeyou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, norpersuasion can with ease attempt you, I will gofurther than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of theduke: you know the character, I doubt not; and thesignet is not strange to you.ProvostI know them both.DUKE VINCENTIOThe contents of this is the return of the duke: youshall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where youshall find, within these two days he will be here.This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he thisvery day receives letters of strange tenor;perchance of the duke's death; perchance enteringinto some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of whatis writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up theshepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how thesethings should be: all difficulties are but easywhen they are known. Call your executioner, and offwith Barnardine's head: I will give him a presentshrift and advise him for a better place. Yet youare amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.Come away; it is almost clear dawn.ExeuntSCENE III.

She's come to knowIf yet her brother's pardon be come hither:But I will keep her ignorant of her good,To make her heavenly comforts of despair,When it is least expected.Enter ISABELLAISABELLAHo, by your leave!DUKE VINCENTIOGood morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.ISABELLAThe better, given me by so holy a man.Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?DUKE VINCENTIOHe hath released him, Isabel, from the world:His head is off and sent to Angelo.ISABELLANay, but it is not so.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,In your close patience.ISABELLAO, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!DUKE VINCENTIOYou shall not be admitted to his sight.ISABELLAUnhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!Injurious world! most damned Angelo!DUKE VINCENTIOThis nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.Mark what I say, which you shall findBy every syllable a faithful verity:The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;One of our convent, and his confessor,Gives me this instance: already he hath carriedNotice to Escalus and Angelo,Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdomIn that good path that I would wish it go,And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,And general honour.ISABELLAI am directed by you.DUKE VINCENTIOThis letter, then, to Friar Peter give;'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:Say, by this token, I desire his companyAt Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yoursI'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring youBefore the duke, and to the head of AngeloAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,I am combined by a sacred vowAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:Command these fretting waters from your eyesWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,If I pervert your course. Who's here?Enter LUCIOLUCIOGood even. Friar, where's the provost?DUKE VINCENTIONot within, sir.LUCIOO pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to seethine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fainto dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not formy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would setme to 't. But they say the duke will be hereto-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had beenat home, he had lived.Exit ISABELLADUKE VINCENTIOSir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to yourreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.LUCIOFriar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.DUKE VINCENTIOWell, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.LUCIONay, tarry; I'll go along with theeI can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.DUKE VINCENTIOYou have told me too many of him already, sir, ifthey be true; if not true, none were enough.LUCIOI was once before him for getting a wench with child.DUKE VINCENTIODid you such a thing?LUCIOYes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.DUKE VINCENTIOSir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.LUCIOBy my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little ofit. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.ExeuntSCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.Enter ANGELO and ESCALUSESCALUSEvery letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.ANGELOIn most uneven and distracted manner. His actionsshow much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom benot tainted! And why meet him at the gates, andredeliver our authorities thereESCALUSI guess not.ANGELOAnd why should we proclaim it in an hour before hisentering, that if any crave redress of injustice,they should exhibit their petitions in the street?ESCALUSHe shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch ofcomplaints, and to deliver us from deviceshereafter, which shall then have no power to standagainst us.ANGELOWell, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimesi' the morn; I'll call you at your house: givenotice to such men of sort and suit as are to meethim.ESCALUSI shall, sir. Fare you well.ANGELOGood night.Exit ESCALUSThis deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnantAnd dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!And by an eminent body that enforcedThe law against it! But that her tender shameWill not proclaim against her maiden loss,How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;For my authority bears of a credent bulk,That no particular scandal once can touchBut it confounds the breather. He should have lived,Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,By so receiving a dishonour'd lifeWith ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.ExitSCENE V. Fields without the town.Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETERDUKE VINCENTIOThese letters at fit time deliver meGiving lettersThe provost knows our purpose and our plot.The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,And hold you ever to our special drift;Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,And tell him where I stay: give the like noticeTo Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;But send me Flavius first.FRIAR PETERIt shall be speeded well.ExitEnter VARRIUSDUKE VINCENTIOI thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:Come, we will walk. There's other of our friendsWill greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.ExeuntSCENE VI. Street near the city gate.Enter ISABELLA and MARIANAISABELLATo speak so indirectly I am loath:I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;He says, to veil full purpose.MARIANABe ruled by him.ISABELLABesides, he tells me that, if peradventureHe speak against me on the adverse side,I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physicThat's bitter to sweet end.MARIANAI would Friar Peter--ISABELLAO, peace! the friar is come.Enter FRIAR PETERFRIAR PETERCome, I have found you out a stand most fit,Where you may have such vantage on the duke,He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;The generous and gravest citizensHave hent the gates, and very near uponThe duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!ExeuntACT VSCENE I. The city gate.MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their  stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords,  ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doorsDUKE VINCENTIOMy very worthy cousin, fairly met!Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.ANGELOESCALUSHappy return be to your royal grace!DUKE VINCENTIOMany and hearty thankings to you both.We have made inquiry of you; and we hearSuch goodness of your justice, that our soulCannot but yield you forth to public thanks,Forerunning more requital.ANGELOYou make my bonds still greater.DUKE VINCENTIOO, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,When it deserves, with characters of brass,A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of timeAnd razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,And let the subject see, to make them knowThat outward courtesies would fain proclaimFavours that keep within. Come, Escalus,You must walk by us on our other hand;And good supporters are you.FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forwardFRIAR PETERNow is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.ISABELLAJustice, O royal duke! Vail your regardUpon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!O worthy prince, dishonour not your eyeBy throwing it on any other objectTill you have heard me in my true complaintAnd given me justice, justice, justice, justice!DUKE VINCENTIORelate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:Reveal yourself to him.ISABELLAO worthy duke,You bid me seek redemption of the devil:Hear me yourself; for that which I must speakMust either punish me, not being believed,Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!ANGELOMy lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:She hath been a suitor to me for her brotherCut off by course of justice,--ISABELLABy course of justice!ANGELOAnd she will speak most bitterly and strange.ISABELLAMost strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?That Angelo is an adulterous thief,An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;Is it not strange and strange?DUKE VINCENTIONay, it is ten times strange.ISABELLAIt is not truer he is AngeloThan this is all as true as it is strange:Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truthTo the end of reckoning.DUKE VINCENTIOAway with her! Poor soul,She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.ISABELLAO prince, I conjure thee, as thou believestThere is another comfort than this world,That thou neglect me not, with that opinionThat I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossibleThat which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossibleBut one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absoluteAs Angelo; even so may Angelo,In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,Had I more name for badness.DUKE VINCENTIOBy mine honesty,If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,Such a dependency of thing on thing,As e'er I heard in madness.ISABELLAO gracious duke,Harp not on that, nor do not banish reasonFor inequality; but let your reason serveTo make the truth appear where it seems hid,And hide the false seems true.DUKE VINCENTIOMany that are not madHave, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?ISABELLAI am the sister of one Claudio,Condemn'd upon the act of fornicationTo lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:I, in probation of a sisterhood,Was sent to by my brother; one LucioAs then the messenger,--LUCIOThat's I, an't like your grace:I came to her from Claudio, and desired herTo try her gracious fortune with Lord AngeloFor her poor brother's pardon.ISABELLAThat's he indeed.DUKE VINCENTIOYou were not bid to speak.LUCIONo, my good lord;Nor wish'd to hold my peace.DUKE VINCENTIOI wish you now, then;Pray you, take note of it: and when you haveA business for yourself, pray heaven you thenBe perfect.LUCIOI warrant your honour.DUKE VINCENTIOThe warrants for yourself; take heed to't.ISABELLAThis gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--LUCIORight.DUKE VINCENTIOIt may be right; but you are i' the wrongTo speak before your time. Proceed.ISABELLAI wentTo this pernicious caitiff deputy,--DUKE VINCENTIOThat's somewhat madly spoken.ISABELLAPardon it;The phrase is to the matter.DUKE VINCENTIOMended again. The matter; proceed.ISABELLAIn brief, to set the needless process by,How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--For this was of much length,--the vile conclusionI now begin with grief and shame to utter:He would not, but by gift of my chaste bodyTo his concupiscible intemperate lust,Release my brother; and, after much debatement,My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrantFor my poor brother's head.DUKE VINCENTIOThis is most likely!ISABELLAO, that it were as like as it is true!DUKE VINCENTIOBy heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,Or else thou art suborn'd against his honourIn hateful practise. First, his integrityStands without blemish. Next, it imports no reasonThat with such vehemency he should pursueFaults proper to himself: if he had so offended,He would have weigh'd thy brother by himselfAnd not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:Confess the truth, and say by whose adviceThou camest here to complain.ISABELLAAnd is this all?Then, O you blessed ministers above,Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd timeUnfold the evil which is here wrapt upIn countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!DUKE VINCENTIOI know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!To prison with her! Shall we thus permitA blasting and a scandalous breath to fallOn him so near us? This needs must be a practise.Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?ISABELLAOne that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.DUKE VINCENTIOA ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?LUCIOMy lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lordFor certain words he spake against your graceIn your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.DUKE VINCENTIOWords against me? this is a good friar, belike!And to set on this wretched woman hereAgainst our substitute! Let this friar be found.LUCIOBut yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,A very scurvy fellow.FRIAR PETERBlessed be your royal grace!I have stood by, my lord, and I have heardYour royal ear abused. First, hath this womanMost wrongfully accused your substitute,Who is as free from touch or soil with herAs she from one ungot.DUKE VINCENTIOWe did believe no less.Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?FRIAR PETERI know him for a man divine and holy;Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,As he's reported by this gentleman;And, on my trust, a man that never yetDid, as he vouches, misreport your grace.LUCIOMy lord, most villanously; believe it.FRIAR PETERWell, he in time may come to clear himself;But at this instant he is sick my lord,Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,Being come to knowledge that there was complaintIntended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth knowIs true and false; and what he with his oathAnd all probation will make up full clear,Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.To justify this worthy nobleman,So vulgarly and personally accused,Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,Till she herself confess it.DUKE VINCENTIOGood friar, let's hear it.ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forwardDo you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;In this I'll be impartial; be you judgeOf your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?First, let her show her face, and after speak.MARIANAPardon, my lord; I will not show my faceUntil my husband bid me.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat, are you married?MARIANANo, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOAre you a maid?MARIANANo, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOA widow, then?MARIANANeither, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?LUCIOMy lord, she may be a punk; for many of them areneither maid, widow, nor wife.DUKE VINCENTIOSilence that fellow: I would he had some causeTo prattle for himself.LUCIOWell, my lord.MARIANAMy lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;And I confess besides I am no maid:I have known my husband; yet my husbandKnows not that ever he knew me.LUCIOHe was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.DUKE VINCENTIOFor the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!LUCIOWell, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOThis is no witness for Lord Angelo.MARIANANow I come to't my lordShe that accuses him of fornication,In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,And charges him my lord, with such a timeWhen I'll depose I had him in mine armsWith all the effect of love.ANGELOCharges she more than me?MARIANANot that I know.DUKE VINCENTIONo? you say your husband.MARIANAWhy, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.ANGELOThis is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.MARIANAMy husband bids me; now I will unmask.UnveilingThis is that face, thou cruel Angelo,Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the bodyThat took away the match from Isabel,And did supply thee at thy garden-houseIn her imagined person.DUKE VINCENTIOKnow you this woman?LUCIOCarnally, she says.DUKE VINCENTIOSirrah, no more!LUCIOEnough, my lord.ANGELOMy lord, I must confess I know this woman:And five years since there was some speech of marriageBetwixt myself and her; which was broke off,Partly for that her promised proportionsCame short of composition, but in chiefFor that her reputation was disvaluedIn levity: since which time of five yearsI never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,Upon my faith and honour.MARIANANoble prince,As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,I am affianced this man's wife as stronglyAs words could make up vows: and, my good lord,But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-houseHe knew me as a wife. As this is true,Let me in safety raise me from my kneesOr else for ever be confixed here,A marble monument!ANGELOI did but smile till now:Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justiceMy patience here is touch'd. I do perceiveThese poor informal women are no moreBut instruments of some more mightier memberThat sets them on: let me have way, my lord,To find this practise out.DUKE VINCENTIOAy, with my heartAnd punish them to your height of pleasure.Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,Though they would swear down each particular saint,Were testimonies against his worth and creditThat's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind painsTo find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.There is another friar that set them on;Let him be sent for.FRIAR PETERWould he were here, my lord! for he indeedHath set the women on to this complaint:Your provost knows the place where he abidesAnd he may fetch him.DUKE VINCENTIOGo do it instantly.Exit ProvostAnd you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,Do with your injuries as seems you best,In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;But stir not you till you have well determinedUpon these slanderers.ESCALUSMy lord, we'll do it throughly.Exit DUKESignior Lucio, did not you say you knew thatFriar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?LUCIO'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothingbut in his clothes; and one that hath spoke mostvillanous speeches of the duke.ESCALUSWe shall entreat you to abide here till he come andenforce them against him: we shall find this friar anotable fellow.LUCIOAs any in Vienna, on my word.ESCALUSCall that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.Exit an AttendantPray you, my lord, give me leave to question; youshall see how I'll handle her.LUCIONot better than he, by her own report.ESCALUSSay you?LUCIOMarry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,she'll be ashamed.ESCALUSI will go darkly to work with her.LUCIOThat's the way; for women are light at midnight.Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habitESCALUSCome on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies allthat you have said.LUCIOMy lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here withthe provost.ESCALUSIn very good time: speak not you to him till wecall upon you.LUCIOMum.ESCALUSCome, sir: did you set these women on to slanderLord Angelo? they have confessed you did.DUKE VINCENTIO'Tis false.ESCALUSHow! know you where you are?DUKE VINCENTIORespect to your great place! and let the devilBe sometime honour'd for his burning throne!Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.ESCALUSThe duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:Look you speak justly.DUKE VINCENTIOBoldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,Thus to retort your manifest appeal,And put your trial in the villain's mouthWhich here you come to accuse.LUCIOThis is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.ESCALUSWhy, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these womenTo accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouthAnd in the witness of his proper ear,To call him villain? and then to glance from himTo the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse youJoint by joint, but we will know his purpose.What 'unjust'!DUKE VINCENTIOBe not so hot; the dukeDare no more stretch this finger of mine than heDare rack his own: his subject am I not,Nor here provincial. My business in this stateMade me a looker on here in Vienna,Where I have seen corruption boil and bubbleTill it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutesStand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,As much in mock as mark.ESCALUSSlander to the state! Away with him to prison!ANGELOWhat can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?Is this the man that you did tell us of?LUCIO'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:do you know me?DUKE VINCENTIOI remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: Imet you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.LUCIOO, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?DUKE VINCENTIOMost notedly, sir.LUCIODo you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, afool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?DUKE VINCENTIOYou must, sir, change persons with me, ere you makethat my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; andmuch more, much worse.LUCIOO thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by thenose for thy speeches?DUKE VINCENTIOI protest I love the duke as I love myself.ANGELOHark, how the villain would close now, after histreasonable abuses!ESCALUSSuch a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away withhim to prison! Where is the provost? Away with himto prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let himspeak no more. Away with those giglots too, andwith the other confederate companion!DUKE VINCENTIO[To Provost]  Stay, sir; stay awhile.ANGELOWhat, resists he? Help him, Lucio.LUCIOCome, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, youbald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, mustyou? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!Will't not off?Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIODUKE VINCENTIOThou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.To LUCIOSneak not away, sir; for the friar and youMust have a word anon. Lay hold on him.LUCIOThis may prove worse than hanging.DUKE VINCENTIO[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:We'll borrow place of him.To ANGELOSir, by your leave.Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,Rely upon it till my tale be heard,And hold no longer out.ANGELOO my dread lord,I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,To think I can be undiscernible,When I perceive your grace, like power divine,Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,No longer session hold upon my shame,But let my trial be mine own confession:Immediate sentence then and sequent deathIs all the grace I beg.DUKE VINCENTIOCome hither, Mariana.Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?ANGELOI was, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOGo take her hence, and marry her instantly.Do you the office, friar; which consummate,Return him here again. Go with him, provost.Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and ProvostESCALUSMy lord, I am more amazed at his dishonourThan at the strangeness of it.DUKE VINCENTIOCome hither, Isabel.Your friar is now your prince: as I was thenAdvertising and holy to your business,Not changing heart with habit, I am stillAttorney'd at your service.ISABELLAO, give me pardon,That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'dYour unknown sovereignty!DUKE VINCENTIOYou are pardon'd, Isabel:And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;And you may marvel why I obscured myself,Labouring to save his life, and would not ratherMake rash remonstrance of my hidden powerThan let him so be lost. O most kind maid,It was the swift celerity of his death,Which I did think with slower foot came on,That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!That life is better life, past fearing death,Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,So happy is your brother.ISABELLAI do, my lord.Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and ProvostDUKE VINCENTIOFor this new-married man approaching here,Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'dYour well defended honour, you must pardonFor Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--Being criminal, in double violationOf sacred chastity and of promise-breachThereon dependent, for your brother's life,--The very mercy of the law cries outMost audible, even from his proper tongue,'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.We do condemn thee to the very blockWhere Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.Away with him!MARIANAO my most gracious lord,I hope you will not mock me with a husband.DUKE VINCENTIOIt is your husband mock'd you with a husband.Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,For that he knew you, might reproach your lifeAnd choke your good to come; for his possessions,Although by confiscation they are ours,We do instate and widow you withal,To buy you a better husband.MARIANAO my dear lord,I crave no other, nor no better man.DUKE VINCENTIONever crave him; we are definitive.MARIANAGentle my liege,--KneelingDUKE VINCENTIOYou do but lose your labour.Away with him to death!To LUCIONow, sir, to you.MARIANAO my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;Lend me your knees, and all my life to comeI'll lend you all my life to do you service.DUKE VINCENTIOAgainst all sense you do importune her:Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,And take her hence in horror.MARIANAIsabel,Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.They say, best men are moulded out of faults;And, for the most, become much more the betterFor being a little bad: so may my husband.O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?DUKE VINCENTIOHe dies for Claudio's death.ISABELLAMost bounteous sir,KneelingLook, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,As if my brother lived: I partly thinkA due sincerity govern'd his deeds,Till he did look on me: since it is so,Let him not die. My brother had but justice,In that he did the thing for which he died:For Angelo,His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,And must be buried but as an intentThat perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;Intents but merely thoughts.MARIANAMerely, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOYour suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.I have bethought me of another fault.Provost, how came it Claudio was beheadedAt an unusual hour?ProvostIt was commanded so.DUKE VINCENTIOHad you a special warrant for the deed?ProvostNo, my good lord; it was by private message.DUKE VINCENTIOFor which I do discharge you of your office:Give up your keys.ProvostPardon me, noble lord:I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;Yet did repent me, after more advice;For testimony whereof, one in the prison,That should by private order else have died,I have reserved alive.DUKE VINCENTIOWhat's he?ProvostHis name is Barnardine.DUKE VINCENTIOI would thou hadst done so by Claudio.Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.Exit ProvostESCALUSI am sorry, one so learned and so wiseAs you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.ANGELOI am sorry that such sorrow I procure:And so deep sticks it in my penitent heartThat I crave death more willingly than mercy;'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIETDUKE VINCENTIOWhich is that Barnardine?ProvostThis, my lord.DUKE VINCENTIOThere was a friar told me of this man.Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.That apprehends no further than this world,And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;And pray thee take this mercy to provideFor better times to come. Friar, advise him;I leave him to your hand.
