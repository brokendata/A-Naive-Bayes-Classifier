ACT IPROLOGUETwo households, both alike in dignity,In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.From forth the fatal loins of these two foesA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;Whose misadventured piteous overthrowsDo with their death bury their parents' strife.The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,And the continuance of their parents' rage,Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;The which if you with patient ears attend,What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.SCENE I. Verona. A public place.Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklersSAMPSONGregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.GREGORYNo, for then we should be colliers.SAMPSONI mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.GREGORYAy, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.SAMPSONI strike quickly, being moved.GREGORYBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.SAMPSONA dog of the house of Montague moves me.GREGORYTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.SAMPSONA dog of that house shall move me to stand: I willtake the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.GREGORYThat shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goesto the wall.SAMPSONTrue; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will pushMontague's men from the wall, and thrust his maidsto the wall.GREGORYThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.SAMPSON'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when Ihave fought with the men, I will be cruel with themaids, and cut off their heads.GREGORYThe heads of the maids?SAMPSONAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;take it in what sense thou wilt.GREGORYThey must take it in sense that feel it.SAMPSONMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.GREGORY'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thouhadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comestwo of the house of the Montagues.SAMPSONMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.GREGORYHow! turn thy back and run?SAMPSONFear me not.GREGORYNo, marry; I fear thee!SAMPSONLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.GREGORYI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it asthey list.SAMPSONNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASARABRAHAMDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?SAMPSONI do bite my thumb, sir.ABRAHAMDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?SAMPSON[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I sayay?GREGORYNo.SAMPSONNo, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but Ibite my thumb, sir.GREGORYDo you quarrel, sir?ABRAHAMQuarrel sir! no, sir.SAMPSONIf you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.ABRAHAMNo better.SAMPSONWell, sir.GREGORYSay 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.SAMPSONYes, better, sir.ABRAHAMYou lie.SAMPSONDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.They fightEnter BENVOLIOBENVOLIOPart, fools!Put up your swords; you know not what you do.Beats down their swordsEnter TYBALTTYBALTWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.BENVOLIOI do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,Or manage it to part these men with me.TYBALTWhat, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:Have at thee, coward!They fightEnter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubsFirst CitizenClubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULETCAPULETWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!LADY CAPULETA crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?CAPULETMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,And flourishes his blade in spite of me.Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUEMONTAGUEThou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.LADY MONTAGUEThou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.Enter PRINCE, with AttendantsPRINCERebellious subjects, enemies to peace,Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,That quench the fire of your pernicious rageWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,On pain of torture, from those bloody handsThrow your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,And hear the sentence of your moved prince.Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,And made Verona's ancient citizensCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,To wield old partisans, in hands as old,Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:If ever you disturb our streets again,Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.For this time, all the rest depart away:You Capulet; shall go along with me:And, Montague, come you this afternoon,To know our further pleasure in this case,To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIOMONTAGUEWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?BENVOLIOHere were the servants of your adversary,And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:I drew to part them: in the instant cameThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,He swung about his head and cut the winds,Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,Came more and more and fought on part and part,Till the prince came, who parted either part.LADY MONTAGUEO, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?Right glad I am he was not at this fray.BENVOLIOMadam, an hour before the worshipp'd sunPeer'd forth the golden window of the east,A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;Where, underneath the grove of sycamoreThat westward rooteth from the city's side,So early walking did I see your son:Towards him I made, but he was ware of meAnd stole into the covert of the wood:I, measuring his affections by my own,That most are busied when they're most alone,Pursued my humour not pursuing his,And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.MONTAGUEMany a morning hath he there been seen,With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;But all so soon as the all-cheering sunShould in the furthest east begin to drawThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,Away from the light steals home my heavy son,And private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight outAnd makes himself an artificial night:Black and portentous must this humour prove,Unless good counsel may the cause remove.BENVOLIOMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?MONTAGUEI neither know it nor can learn of him.BENVOLIOHave you importuned him by any means?MONTAGUEBoth by myself and many other friends:But he, his own affections' counsellor,Is to himself--I will not say how true--But to himself so secret and so close,So far from sounding and discovery,As is the bud bit with an envious worm,Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.We would as willingly give cure as know.Enter ROMEOBENVOLIOSee, where he comes: so please you, step aside;I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.MONTAGUEI would thou wert so happy by thy stay,To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUEBENVOLIOGood-morrow, cousin.ROMEOIs the day so young?BENVOLIOBut new struck nine.ROMEOAy me! sad hours seem long.Was that my father that went hence so fast?BENVOLIOIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?ROMEONot having that, which, having, makes them short.BENVOLIOIn love?ROMEOOut--BENVOLIOOf love?ROMEOOut of her favour, where I am in love.BENVOLIOAlas, that love, so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!ROMEOAlas, that love, whose view is muffled still,Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!O any thing, of nothing first create!O heavy lightness! serious vanity!Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,sick health!Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!This love feel I, that feel no love in this.Dost thou not laugh?BENVOLIONo, coz, I rather weep.ROMEOGood heart, at what?BENVOLIOAt thy good heart's oppression.ROMEOWhy, such is love's transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prestWith more of thine: this love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:What is it else? a madness most discreet,A choking gall and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz.BENVOLIOSoft! I will go along;An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.ROMEOTut, I have lost myself; I am not here;This is not Romeo, he's some other where.BENVOLIOTell me in sadness, who is that you love.ROMEOWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?BENVOLIOGroan! why, no.But sadly tell me who.ROMEOBid a sick man in sadness make his will:Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.BENVOLIOI aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.ROMEOA right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.BENVOLIOA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.ROMEOWell, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hitWith Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.She will not stay the siege of loving terms,Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,That when she dies with beauty dies her store.BENVOLIOThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?ROMEOShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,For beauty starved with her severityCuts beauty off from all posterity.She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,To merit bliss by making me despair:She hath forsworn to love, and in that vowDo I live dead that live to tell it now.BENVOLIOBe ruled by me, forget to think of her.ROMEOO, teach me how I should forget to think.BENVOLIOBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;Examine other beauties.ROMEO'Tis the wayTo call hers exquisite, in question more:These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' browsBeing black put us in mind they hide the fair;He that is strucken blind cannot forgetThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost:Show me a mistress that is passing fair,What doth her beauty serve, but as a noteWhere I may read who pass'd that passing fair?Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.BENVOLIOI'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.ExeuntSCENE II. A street.Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and ServantCAPULETBut Montague is bound as well as I,In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,For men so old as we to keep the peace.PARISOf honourable reckoning are you both;And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?CAPULETBut saying o'er what I have said before:My child is yet a stranger in the world;She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,Let two more summers wither in their pride,Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.PARISYounger than she are happy mothers made.CAPULETAnd too soon marr'd are those so early made.The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,She is the hopeful lady of my earth:But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,My will to her consent is but a part;An she agree, within her scope of choiceLies my consent and fair according voice.This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,Whereto I have invited many a guest,Such as I love; and you, among the store,One more, most welcome, makes my number more.At my poor house look to behold this nightEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:Such comfort as do lusty young men feelWhen well-apparell'd April on the heelOf limping winter treads, even such delightAmong fresh female buds shall you this nightInherit at my house; hear all, all see,And like her most whose merit most shall be:Which on more view, of many mine being oneMay stand in number, though in reckoning none,Come, go with me.To Servant, giving a paperGo, sirrah, trudge aboutThrough fair Verona; find those persons outWhose names are written there, and to them say,My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.Exeunt CAPULET and PARISServantFind them out whose names are written here! It iswritten, that the shoemaker should meddle with hisyard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher withhis pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I amsent to find those persons whose names are herewrit, and can never find what names the writingperson hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEOBENVOLIOTut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;One desperate grief cures with another's languish:Take thou some new infection to thy eye,And the rank poison of the old will die.ROMEOYour plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.BENVOLIOFor what, I pray thee?ROMEOFor your broken shin.BENVOLIOWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?ROMEONot mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;Shut up in prison, kept without my food,Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.ServantGod gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?ROMEOAy, mine own fortune in my misery.ServantPerhaps you have learned it without book: but, Ipray, can you read any thing you see?ROMEOAy, if I know the letters and the language.ServantYe say honestly: rest you merry!ROMEOStay, fellow; I can read.Reads'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the ladywidow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovelynieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mineuncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair nieceRosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousinTybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fairassembly: whither should they come?ServantUp.ROMEOWhither?ServantTo supper; to our house.ROMEOWhose house?ServantMy master's.ROMEOIndeed, I should have ask'd you that before.ServantNow I'll tell you without asking: my master is thegreat rich Capulet; and if you be not of the houseof Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.Rest you merry!ExitBENVOLIOAt this same ancient feast of Capulet'sSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,With all the admired beauties of Verona:Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,Compare her face with some that I shall show,And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.ROMEOWhen the devout religion of mine eyeMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;And these, who often drown'd could never die,Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sunNe'er saw her match since first the world begun.BENVOLIOTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,Herself poised with herself in either eye:But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'dYour lady's love against some other maidThat I will show you shining at this feast,And she shall scant show well that now shows best.ROMEOI'll go along, no such sight to be shown,But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.ExeuntSCENE III.

How long is it nowTo Lammas-tide?LADY CAPULETA fortnight and odd days.NurseEven or odd, of all days in the year,Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;She was too good for me: but, as I said,On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;That shall she, marry; I remember it well.'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--Of all the days of the year, upon that day:For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;My lord and you were then at Mantua:--Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,To bid me trudge:And since that time it is eleven years;For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,She could have run and waddled all about;For even the day before, she broke her brow:And then my husband--God be with his soul!A' was a merry man--took up the child:'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'To see, now, how a jest shall come about!I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'LADY CAPULETEnough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.NurseYes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'And yet, I warrant, it had upon its browA bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'JULIETAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.NursePeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:An I might live to see thee married once,I have my wish.LADY CAPULETMarry, that 'marry' is the very themeI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,How stands your disposition to be married?JULIETIt is an honour that I dream not of.NurseAn honour! were not I thine only nurse,I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.LADY CAPULETWell, think of marriage now; younger than you,Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,Are made already mothers: by my count,I was your mother much upon these yearsThat you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.NurseA man, young lady! lady, such a manAs all the world--why, he's a man of wax.LADY CAPULETVerona's summer hath not such a flower.NurseNay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.LADY CAPULETWhat say you? can you love the gentleman?This night you shall behold him at our feast;Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;Examine every married lineament,And see how one another lends contentAnd what obscured in this fair volume liesFind written in the margent of his eyes.This precious book of love, this unbound lover,To beautify him, only lacks a cover:The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much prideFor fair without the fair within to hide:That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;So shall you share all that he doth possess,By having him, making yourself no less.NurseNo less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.LADY CAPULETSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?JULIETI'll look to like, if looking liking move:But no more deep will I endart mine eyeThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.Enter a ServantServantMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, youcalled, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed inthe pantry, and every thing in extremity.

A street.Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and othersROMEOWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?Or shall we on without a apology?BENVOLIOThe date is out of such prolixity:We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spokeAfter the prompter, for our entrance:But let them measure us by what they will;We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.ROMEOGive me a torch: I am not for this ambling;Being but heavy, I will bear the light.MERCUTIONay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.ROMEONot I, believe me: you have dancing shoesWith nimble soles: I have a soul of leadSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.MERCUTIOYou are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,And soar with them above a common bound.ROMEOI am too sore enpierced with his shaftTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:Under love's heavy burden do I sink.MERCUTIOAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;Too great oppression for a tender thing.ROMEOIs love a tender thing? it is too rough,Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.MERCUTIOIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.Give me a case to put my visage in:A visor for a visor! what care IWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.BENVOLIOCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in,But every man betake him to his legs.ROMEOA torch for me: let wantons light of heartTickle the senseless rushes with their heels,For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.MERCUTIOTut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mireOf this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'stUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!ROMEONay, that's not so.MERCUTIOI mean, sir, in delayWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.Take our good meaning, for our judgment sitsFive times in that ere once in our five wits.ROMEOAnd we mean well in going to this mask;But 'tis no wit to go.MERCUTIOWhy, may one ask?ROMEOI dream'd a dream to-night.MERCUTIOAnd so did I.ROMEOWell, what was yours?MERCUTIOThat dreamers often lie.ROMEOIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.MERCUTIOO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.She is the fairies' midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agate-stoneOn the fore-finger of an alderman,Drawn with a team of little atomiesAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,The traces of the smallest spider's web,The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,Not so big as a round little wormPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;Her chariot is an empty hazel-nutMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.And in this state she gallops night by nightThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tailTickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,Then dreams, he of another benefice:Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anonDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,And being thus frighted swears a prayer or twoAnd sleeps again. This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the night,And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage:This is she--ROMEOPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace!Thou talk'st of nothing.MERCUTIOTrue, I talk of dreams,Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,Which is as thin of substance as the airAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooesEven now the frozen bosom of the north,And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.BENVOLIOThis wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;Supper is done, and we shall come too late.ROMEOI fear, too early: for my mind misgivesSome consequence yet hanging in the starsShall bitterly begin his fearful dateWith this night's revels and expire the termOf a despised life closed in my breastBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.But He, that hath the steerage of my course,Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.BENVOLIOStrike, drum.ExeuntSCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkinsFirst ServantWhere's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?

What dares the slaveCome hither, cover'd with an antic face,To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.CAPULETWhy, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?TYBALTUncle, this is a Montague, our foe,A villain that is hither come in spite,To scorn at our solemnity this night.CAPULETYoung Romeo is it?TYBALT'Tis he, that villain Romeo.CAPULETContent thee, gentle coz, let him alone;He bears him like a portly gentleman;And, to say truth, Verona brags of himTo be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:I would not for the wealth of all the townHere in my house do him disparagement:Therefore be patient, take no note of him:It is my will, the which if thou respect,Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.TYBALTIt fits, when such a villain is a guest:I'll not endure him.CAPULETHe shall be endured:What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;Am I the master here, or you? go to.You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!You'll make a mutiny among my guests!You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!TYBALTWhy, uncle, 'tis a shame.CAPULETGo to, go to;You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.Well said, my hearts!

O, be some other name!What's in a name? that which we call a roseBy any other name would smell as sweet;So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,Retain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,And for that name which is no part of theeTake all myself.ROMEOI take thee at thy word:Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;Henceforth I never will be Romeo.JULIETWhat man art thou that thus bescreen'd in nightSo stumblest on my counsel?ROMEOBy a nameI know not how to tell thee who I am:My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,Because it is an enemy to thee;Had I it written, I would tear the word.JULIETMy ears have not yet drunk a hundred wordsOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?ROMEONeither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.JULIETHow camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,And the place death, considering who thou art,If any of my kinsmen find thee here.ROMEOWith love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;For stony limits cannot hold love out,And what love can do that dares love attempt;Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.JULIETIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.ROMEOAlack, there lies more peril in thine eyeThan twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,And I am proof against their enmity.JULIETI would not for the world they saw thee here.ROMEOI have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;And but thou love me, let them find me here:My life were better ended by their hate,Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.JULIETBy whose direction found'st thou out this place?ROMEOBy love, who first did prompt me to inquire;He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as farAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,I would adventure for such merchandise.JULIETThou know'st the mask of night is on my face,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheekFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-nightFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain denyWhat I have spoke: but farewell compliment!Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuriesThen say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more trueThan those that have more cunning to be strange.I should have been more strange, I must confess,But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,And not impute this yielding to light love,Which the dark night hath so discovered.ROMEOLady, by yonder blessed moon I swearThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--JULIETO, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,That monthly changes in her circled orb,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.ROMEOWhat shall I swear by?JULIETDo not swear at all;Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,And I'll believe thee.ROMEOIf my heart's dear love--JULIETWell, do not swear: although I joy in thee,I have no joy of this contract to-night:It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;Too like the lightning, which doth cease to beEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.Good night, good night! as sweet repose and restCome to thy heart as that within my breast!ROMEOO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?JULIETWhat satisfaction canst thou have to-night?ROMEOThe exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.JULIETI gave thee mine before thou didst request it:And yet I would it were to give again.ROMEOWouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?JULIETBut to be frank, and give it thee again.And yet I wish but for the thing I have:My bounty is as boundless as the sea,My love as deep; the more I give to thee,The more I have, for both are infinite.Nurse calls withinI hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.Stay but a little, I will come again.Exit, aboveROMEOO blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.Being in night, all this is but a dream,Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.Re-enter JULIET, aboveJULIETThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.If that thy bent of love be honourable,Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,By one that I'll procure to come to thee,Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll layAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.Nurse[Within]  Madam!JULIETI come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,I do beseech thee--Nurse[Within]  Madam!JULIETBy and by, I come:--To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:To-morrow will I send.ROMEOSo thrive my soul--JULIETA thousand times good night!Exit, aboveROMEOA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.Love goes toward love, as schoolboys fromtheir books,But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.RetiringRe-enter JULIET, aboveJULIETHist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,To lure this tassel-gentle back again!Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,With repetition of my Romeo's name.ROMEOIt is my soul that calls upon my name:How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,Like softest music to attending ears!JULIETRomeo!ROMEOMy dear?JULIETAt what o'clock to-morrowShall I send to thee?ROMEOAt the hour of nine.JULIETI will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.I have forgot why I did call thee back.ROMEOLet me stand here till thou remember it.JULIETI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,Remembering how I love thy company.ROMEOAnd I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,Forgetting any other home but this.JULIET'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:And yet no further than a wanton's bird;Who lets it hop a little from her hand,Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,And with a silk thread plucks it back again,So loving-jealous of his liberty.ROMEOI would I were thy bird.JULIETSweet, so would I:Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.Good night, good night! parting is suchsweet sorrow,That I shall say good night till it be morrow.Exit aboveROMEOSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.ExitSCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basketFRIAR LAURENCEThe grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,And flecked darkness like a drunkard reelsFrom forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,I must up-fill this osier cage of oursWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;What is her burying grave that is her womb,And from her womb children of divers kindWe sucking on her natural bosom find,Many for many virtues excellent,None but for some and yet all different.O, mickle is the powerful grace that liesIn herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:For nought so vile that on the earth doth liveBut to the earth some special good doth give,Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair useRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;And vice sometimes by action dignified.Within the infant rind of this small flowerPoison hath residence and medicine power:For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.Two such opposed kings encamp them stillIn man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;And where the worser is predominant,Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.Enter ROMEOROMEOGood morrow, father.FRIAR LAURENCEBenedicite!What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?Young son, it argues a distemper'd headSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brainDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:Therefore thy earliness doth me assureThou art up-roused by some distemperature;Or if not so, then here I hit it right,Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.ROMEOThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.FRIAR LAURENCEGod pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?ROMEOWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.FRIAR LAURENCEThat's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?ROMEOI'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.I have been feasting with mine enemy,Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,That's by me wounded: both our remediesWithin thy help and holy physic lies:I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,My intercession likewise steads my foe.FRIAR LAURENCEBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.ROMEOThen plainly know my heart's dear love is setOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet:As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;And all combined, save what thou must combineBy holy marriage: when and where and howWe met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,That thou consent to marry us to-day.FRIAR LAURENCEHoly Saint Francis, what a change is here!Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,So soon forsaken? young men's love then liesNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.Jesu Maria, what a deal of brineHath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!How much salt water thrown away in waste,To season love, that of it doth not taste!The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sitOf an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.ROMEOThou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.FRIAR LAURENCEFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.ROMEOAnd bad'st me bury love.FRIAR LAURENCENot in a grave,To lay one in, another out to have.ROMEOI pray thee, chide not; she whom I love nowDoth grace for grace and love for love allow;The other did not so.FRIAR LAURENCEO, she knew wellThy love did read by rote and could not spell.But come, young waverer, come, go with me,In one respect I'll thy assistant be;For this alliance may so happy prove,To turn your households' rancour to pure love.ROMEOO, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.FRIAR LAURENCEWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.ExeuntSCENE IV.

Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEOFRIAR LAURENCESo smile the heavens upon this holy act,That after hours with sorrow chide us not!ROMEOAmen, amen! but come what sorrow can,It cannot countervail the exchange of joyThat one short minute gives me in her sight:Do thou but close our hands with holy words,Then love-devouring death do what he dare;It is enough I may but call her mine.FRIAR LAURENCEThese violent delights have violent endsAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honeyIs loathsome in his own deliciousnessAnd in the taste confounds the appetite:Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.Enter JULIETHere comes the lady: O, so light a footWill ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:A lover may bestride the gossamerThat idles in the wanton summer air,And yet not fall; so light is vanity.JULIETGood even to my ghostly confessor.FRIAR LAURENCERomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.JULIETAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.ROMEOAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joyBe heap'd like mine and that thy skill be moreTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breathThis neighbour air, and let rich music's tongueUnfold the imagined happiness that bothReceive in either by this dear encounter.JULIETConceit, more rich in matter than in words,Brags of his substance, not of ornament:They are but beggars that can count their worth;But my true love is grown to such excessI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.FRIAR LAURENCECome, come with me, and we will make short work;For, by your leaves, you shall not stay aloneTill holy church incorporate two in one.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I.

Thou! why,thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thouwilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having noother reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: whateye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full ofmeat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle asan egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with aman for coughing in the street, because he hathwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearinghis new doublet before Easter? with another, fortying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thouwilt tutor me from quarrelling!BENVOLIOAn I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any manshould buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.MERCUTIOThe fee-simple!

A plague o' both your houses!They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,And soundly too: your houses!Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIOROMEOThis gentleman, the prince's near ally,My very friend, hath got his mortal hurtIn my behalf; my reputation stain'dWith Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hourHath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,Thy beauty hath made me effeminateAnd in my temper soften'd valour's steel!Re-enter BENVOLIOBENVOLIOO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.ROMEOThis day's black fate on more days doth depend;This but begins the woe, others must end.BENVOLIOHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.ROMEOAlive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!Away to heaven, respective lenity,And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!Re-enter TYBALTNow, Tybalt, take the villain back again,That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soulIs but a little way above our heads,Staying for thine to keep him company:Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.TYBALTThou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,Shalt with him hence.ROMEOThis shall determine that.They fight; TYBALT fallsBENVOLIORomeo, away, be gone!The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!ROMEOO, I am fortune's fool!BENVOLIOWhy dost thou stay?Exit ROMEOEnter Citizens,  & cFirst CitizenWhich way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?BENVOLIOThere lies that Tybalt.First CitizenUp, sir, go with me;I charge thee in the princes name, obey.Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and othersPRINCEWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?BENVOLIOO noble prince, I can discover allThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.LADY CAPULETTybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spiltO my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.O cousin, cousin!PRINCEBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?BENVOLIOTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethinkHow nice the quarrel was, and urged withalYour high displeasure: all this utteredWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,Could not take truce with the unruly spleenOf Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tiltsWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beatsCold death aside, and with the other sendsIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter thanhis tongue,His agile arm beats down their fatal points,And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose armAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the lifeOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;But by and by comes back to Romeo,Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere ICould draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.LADY CAPULETHe is a kinsman to the Montague;Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,And all those twenty could but kill one life.I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.PRINCERomeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?MONTAGUENot Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;His fault concludes but what the law should end,The life of Tybalt.PRINCEAnd for that offenceImmediately we do exile him hence:I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;But I'll amerce you with so strong a fineThat you shall all repent the loss of mine:I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.Bear hence this body and attend our will:Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.ExeuntSCENE II. Capulet's orchard.Enter JULIETJULIETGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagonerAs Phaethon would whip you to the west,And bring in cloudy night immediately.Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,That runaway's eyes may wink and RomeoLeap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.Lovers can see to do their amorous ritesBy their own beauties; or, if love be blind,It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,And learn me how to lose a winning match,Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,Think true love acted simple modesty.Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightWhiter than new snow on a raven's back.Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with nightAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.O, I have bought the mansion of a love,But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this dayAs is the night before some festivalTo an impatient child that hath new robesAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,And she brings news; and every tongue that speaksBut Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.Enter Nurse, with cordsNow, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cordsThat Romeo bid thee fetch?NurseAy, ay, the cords.Throws them downJULIETAy me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?NurseAh, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!We are undone, lady, we are undone!Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!JULIETCan heaven be so envious?NurseRomeo can,Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!JULIETWhat devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison moreThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice:I am not I, if there be such an I;Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.NurseI saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.JULIETO, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!NurseO Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!That ever I should live to see thee dead!JULIETWhat storm is this that blows so contrary?Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!For who is living, if those two are gone?NurseTybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.JULIETO God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?NurseIt did, it did; alas the day, it did!JULIETO serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!Despised substance of divinest show!Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,A damned saint, an honourable villain!O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiendIn moral paradise of such sweet flesh?Was ever book containing such vile matterSo fairly bound? O that deceit should dwellIn such a gorgeous palace!NurseThere's no trust,No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.Shame come to Romeo!JULIETBlister'd be thy tongueFor such a wish! he was not born to shame:Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'dSole monarch of the universal earth.O, what a beast was I to chide at him!NurseWill you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?JULIETShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;Your tributary drops belong to woe,Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;But, O, it presses to my memory,Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's deathWas woe enough, if it had ended there:Or, if sour woe delights in fellowshipAnd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,Which modern lamentations might have moved?But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?NurseWeeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.JULIETWash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:He made you for a highway to my bed;But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!NurseHie to your chamber: I'll find RomeoTo comfort you: I wot well where he is.Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.JULIETO, find him! give this ring to my true knight,And bid him come to take his last farewell.ExeuntSCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCEFRIAR LAURENCERomeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,And thou art wedded to calamity.Enter ROMEOROMEOFather, what news? what is the prince's doom?What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,That I yet know not?FRIAR LAURENCEToo familiarIs my dear son with such sour company:I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.ROMEOWhat less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?FRIAR LAURENCEA gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,Not body's death, but body's banishment.ROMEOHa, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'For exile hath more terror in his look,Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'FRIAR LAURENCEHence from Verona art thou banished:Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.ROMEOThere is no world without Verona walls,But purgatory, torture, hell itself.Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,And world's exile is death: then banished,Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.FRIAR LAURENCEO deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,And turn'd that black word death to banishment:This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.ROMEO'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dogAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,Live here in heaven and may look on her;But Romeo may not: more validity,More honourable state, more courtship livesIn carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seizeOn the white wonder of dear Juliet's handAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,Who even in pure and vestal modesty,Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;But Romeo may not; he is banished:Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:They are free men, but I am banished.And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?O friar, the damned use that word in hell;Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,To mangle me with that word 'banished'?FRIAR LAURENCEThou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.ROMEOO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.FRIAR LAURENCEI'll give thee armour to keep off that word:Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,To comfort thee, though thou art banished.ROMEOYet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.FRIAR LAURENCEO, then I see that madmen have no ears.ROMEOHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?FRIAR LAURENCELet me dispute with thee of thy estate.ROMEOThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,Doting like me and like me banished,Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,And fall upon the ground, as I do now,Taking the measure of an unmade grave.Knocking withinFRIAR LAURENCEArise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.ROMEONot I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.KnockingFRIAR LAURENCEHark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;KnockingRun to my study. By and by! God's will,What simpleness is this! I come, I come!KnockingWho knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?Nurse[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall knowmy errand;I come from Lady Juliet.FRIAR LAURENCEWelcome, then.Enter NurseNurseO holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?FRIAR LAURENCEThere on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.NurseO, he is even in my mistress' case,Just in her case! O woful sympathy!Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;Why should you fall into so deep an O?ROMEONurse!NurseAh sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.ROMEOSpakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?Doth she not think me an old murderer,Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joyWith blood removed but little from her own?Where is she? and how doth she? and what saysMy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?NurseO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,And then down falls again.ROMEOAs if that name,Shot from the deadly level of a gun,Did murder her; as that name's cursed handMurder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,In what vile part of this anatomyDoth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sackThe hateful mansion.Drawing his swordFRIAR LAURENCEHold thy desperate hand:Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denoteThe unreasonable fury of a beast:Unseemly woman in a seeming man!Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,I thought thy disposition better temper'd.Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,By doing damned hate upon thyself?Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meetIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,And usest none in that true use indeedWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,Digressing from the valour of a man;Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,Misshapen in the conduct of them both,Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,Is set afire by thine own ignorance,And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friendAnd turns it to exile; there art thou happy:A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;Happiness courts thee in her best array;But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:But look thou stay not till the watch be set,For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;Where thou shalt live, till we can find a timeTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee backWith twenty hundred thousand times more joyThan thou went'st forth in lamentation.Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;And bid her hasten all the house to bed,Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:Romeo is coming.NurseO Lord, I could have stay'd here all the nightTo hear good counsel: O, what learning is!My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.ROMEODo so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.NurseHere, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.ExitROMEOHow well my comfort is revived by this!FRIAR LAURENCEGo hence; good night; and here stands all your state:Either be gone before the watch be set,Or by the break of day disguised from hence:Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,And he shall signify from time to timeEvery good hap to you that chances here:Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.ROMEOBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.ExeuntSCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARISCAPULETThings have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,That we have had no time to move our daughter:Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:I promise you, but for your company,I would have been a-bed an hour ago.PARISThese times of woe afford no time to woo.Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.LADY CAPULETI will, and know her mind early to-morrow;To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.CAPULETSir Paris, I will make a desperate tenderOf my child's love: I think she will be ruledIn all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--But, soft! what day is this?PARISMonday, my lord,CAPULETMonday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,She shall be married to this noble earl.Will you be ready? do you like this haste?We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,It may be thought we held him carelessly,Being our kinsman, if we revel much:Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?PARISMy lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.CAPULETWell get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!Afore me! it is so very very late,That we may call it early by and by.Good night.ExeuntSCENE V. Capulet's orchard.Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the windowJULIETWilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:It was the nightingale, and not the lark,That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.ROMEOIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaksDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east:Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund dayStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.I must be gone and live, or stay and die.JULIETYon light is not day-light, I know it, I:It is some meteor that the sun exhales,To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,And light thee on thy way to Mantua:Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.ROMEOLet me be ta'en, let me be put to death;I am content, so thou wilt have it so.I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beatThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads:I have more care to stay than will to go:Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.JULIETIt is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!It is the lark that sings so out of tune,Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.Some say the lark makes sweet division;This doth not so, for she divideth us:Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,O, now I would they had changed voices too!Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.ROMEOMore light and light; more dark and dark our woes!Enter Nurse, to the chamberNurseMadam!JULIETNurse?NurseYour lady mother is coming to your chamber:The day is broke; be wary, look about.ExitJULIETThen, window, let day in, and let life out.ROMEOFarewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.He goeth downJULIETArt thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!I must hear from thee every day in the hour,For in a minute there are many days:O, by this count I shall be much in yearsEre I again behold my Romeo!ROMEOFarewell!I will omit no opportunityThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.JULIETO think'st thou we shall ever meet again?ROMEOI doubt it not; and all these woes shall serveFor sweet discourses in our time to come.JULIETO God, I have an ill-divining soul!Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.ROMEOAnd trust me, love, in my eye so do you:Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!ExitJULIETO fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,But send him back.LADY CAPULET[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?JULIETWho is't that calls? is it my lady mother?Is she not down so late, or up so early?What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?Enter LADY CAPULETLADY CAPULETWhy, how now, Juliet!JULIETMadam, I am not well.LADY CAPULETEvermore weeping for your cousin's death?What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;But much of grief shows still some want of wit.JULIETYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.LADY CAPULETSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friendWhich you weep for.JULIETFeeling so the loss,Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.LADY CAPULETWell, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.JULIETWhat villain madam?LADY CAPULETThat same villain, Romeo.JULIET[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.LADY CAPULETThat is, because the traitor murderer lives.JULIETAy, madam, from the reach of these my hands:Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!LADY CAPULETWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.JULIETIndeed, I never shall be satisfiedWith Romeo, till I behold him--dead--Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.Madam, if you could find out but a manTo bear a poison, I would temper it;That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhorsTo hear him named, and cannot come to him.To wreak the love I bore my cousinUpon his body that slaughter'd him!LADY CAPULETFind thou the means, and I'll find such a man.But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.JULIETAnd joy comes well in such a needy time:What are they, I beseech your ladyship?LADY CAPULETWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child;One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.JULIETMadam, in happy time, what day is that?LADY CAPULETMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn,The gallant, young and noble gentleman,The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.JULIETNow, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,He shall not make me there a joyful bride.I wonder at this haste; that I must wedEre he, that should be husband, comes to woo.I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!LADY CAPULETHere comes your father; tell him so yourself,And see how he will take it at your hands.Enter CAPULET and NurseCAPULETWhen the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;But for the sunset of my brother's sonIt rains downright.How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?Evermore showering? In one little bodyThou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,Without a sudden calm, will oversetThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!Have you deliver'd to her our decree?LADY CAPULETAy, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.I would the fool were married to her grave!CAPULETSoft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,Unworthy as she is, that we have wroughtSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?JULIETNot proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:Proud can I never be of what I hate;But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.CAPULETHow now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!You tallow-face!LADY CAPULETFie, fie! what, are you mad?JULIETGood father, I beseech you on my knees,Hear me with patience but to speak a word.CAPULETHang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,Or never after look me in the face:Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blestThat God had lent us but this only child;But now I see this one is one too much,And that we have a curse in having her:Out on her, hilding!NurseGod in heaven bless her!You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.CAPULETAnd why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.NurseI speak no treason.CAPULETO, God ye god-den.NurseMay not one speak?CAPULETPeace, you mumbling fool!Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;For here we need it not.LADY CAPULETYou are too hot.CAPULETGod's bread! it makes me mad:Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,Alone, in company, still my care hath beenTo have her match'd: and having now providedA gentleman of noble parentage,Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;And then to have a wretched puling fool,A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:Graze where you will you shall not house with me:Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die inthe streets,For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.ExitJULIETIs there no pity sitting in the clouds,That sees into the bottom of my grief?O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!Delay this marriage for a month, a week;Or, if you do not, make the bridal bedIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.LADY CAPULETTalk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.ExitJULIETO God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;How shall that faith return again to earth,Unless that husband send it me from heavenBy leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagemsUpon so soft a subject as myself!What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?Some comfort, nurse.NurseFaith, here it is.Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,I think it best you married with the county.O, he's a lovely gentleman!Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eyeAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,I think you are happy in this second match,For it excels your first: or if it did not,Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,As living here and you no use of him.JULIETSpeakest thou from thy heart?NurseAnd from my soul too;Or else beshrew them both.JULIETAmen!NurseWhat?JULIETWell, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,To make confession and to be absolved.NurseMarry, I will; and this is wisely done.ExitJULIETAncient damnation! O most wicked fiend!Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongueWhich she hath praised him with above compareSo many thousand times? Go, counsellor;Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:If all else fail, myself have power to die.ExitACT IVSCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARISFRIAR LAURENCEOn Thursday, sir? the time is very short.PARISMy father Capulet will have it so;And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.FRIAR LAURENCEYou say you do not know the lady's mind:Uneven is the course, I like it not.PARISImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,And therefore have I little talk'd of love;For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.Now, sir, her father counts it dangerousThat she doth give her sorrow so much sway,And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,To stop the inundation of her tears;Which, too much minded by herself alone,May be put from her by society:Now do you know the reason of this haste.FRIAR LAURENCE[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.Enter JULIETPARISHappily met, my lady and my wife!JULIETThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.PARISThat may be must be, love, on Thursday next.JULIETWhat must be shall be.FRIAR LAURENCEThat's a certain text.PARISCome you to make confession to this father?JULIETTo answer that, I should confess to you.PARISDo not deny to him that you love me.JULIETI will confess to you that I love him.PARISSo will ye, I am sure, that you love me.JULIETIf I do so, it will be of more price,Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.PARISPoor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.JULIETThe tears have got small victory by that;For it was bad enough before their spite.PARISThou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.JULIETThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth;And what I spake, I spake it to my face.PARISThy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.JULIETIt may be so, for it is not mine own.Are you at leisure, holy father, now;Or shall I come to you at evening mass?FRIAR LAURENCEMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.My lord, we must entreat the time alone.PARISGod shield I should disturb devotion!Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.ExitJULIETO shut the door! and when thou hast done so,Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!FRIAR LAURENCEAh, Juliet, I already know thy grief;It strains me past the compass of my wits:I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,On Thursday next be married to this county.JULIETTell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,Do thou but call my resolution wise,And with this knife I'll help it presently.God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,Shall be the label to another deed,Or my true heart with treacherous revoltTurn to another, this shall slay them both:Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,Give me some present counsel, or, behold,'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knifeShall play the umpire, arbitrating thatWhich the commission of thy years and artCould to no issue of true honour bring.Be not so long to speak; I long to die,If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.FRIAR LAURENCEHold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,Which craves as desperate an execution.As that is desperate which we would prevent.If, rather than to marry County Paris,Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,Then is it likely thou wilt undertakeA thing like death to chide away this shame,That copest with death himself to scape from it:And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.JULIETO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,From off the battlements of yonder tower;Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurkWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;Or bid me go into a new-made graveAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud;Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;And I will do it without fear or doubt,To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.FRIAR LAURENCEHold, then; go home, be merry, give consentTo marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:Take thou this vial, being then in bed,And this distilled liquor drink thou off;When presently through all thy veins shall runA cold and drowsy humour, for no pulseShall keep his native progress, but surcease:No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fadeTo paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;Each part, deprived of supple government,Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk deathThou shalt continue two and forty hours,And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comesTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:Then, as the manner of our country is,In thy best robes uncover'd on the bierThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vaultWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,And hither shall he come: and he and IWill watch thy waking, and that very nightShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.And this shall free thee from this present shame;If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,Abate thy valour in the acting it.JULIETGive me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!FRIAR LAURENCEHold; get you gone, be strong and prosperousIn this resolve: I'll send a friar with speedTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.JULIETLove give me strength! and strength shall help afford.Farewell, dear father!ExeuntSCENE II.

Let me see the county;Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,Our whole city is much bound to him.JULIETNurse, will you go with me into my closet,To help me sort such needful ornamentsAs you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?LADY CAPULETNo, not till Thursday; there is time enough.CAPULETGo, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.Exeunt JULIET and NurseLADY  CAPULETWe shall be short in our provision:'Tis now near night.CAPULETTush, I will stir about,And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;I'll play the housewife for this once.

Is my father well?How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;For nothing can be ill, if she be well.BALTHASARThen she is well, and nothing can be ill:Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,And her immortal part with angels lives.I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,And presently took post to tell it you:O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,Since you did leave it for my office, sir.ROMEOIs it even so? then I defy you, stars!Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.BALTHASARI do beseech you, sir, have patience:Your looks are pale and wild, and do importSome misadventure.ROMEOTush, thou art deceived:Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?BALTHASARNo, my good lord.ROMEONo matter: get thee gone,And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.Exit BALTHASARWell, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swiftTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men!I do remember an apothecary,--And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I notedIn tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,An alligator stuff'd, and other skinsOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelvesA beggarly account of empty boxes,Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.Noting this penury, to myself I said'An if a man did need a poison now,Whose sale is present death in Mantua,Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'O, this same thought did but forerun my need;And this same needy man must sell it me.As I remember, this should be the house.Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.What, ho! apothecary!Enter ApothecaryApothecaryWho calls so loud?ROMEOCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor:Hold, there is forty ducats: let me haveA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gearAs will disperse itself through all the veinsThat the life-weary taker may fall deadAnd that the trunk may be discharged of breathAs violently as hasty powder firedDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.ApothecarySuch mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's lawIs death to any he that utters them.ROMEOArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;The world affords no law to make thee rich;Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.ApothecaryMy poverty, but not my will, consents.ROMEOI pay thy poverty, and not thy will.ApothecaryPut this in any liquid thing you will,And drink it off; and, if you had the strengthOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.ROMEOThere is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,Doing more murders in this loathsome world,Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.Come, cordial and not poison, go with meTo Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.ExeuntSCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter FRIAR JOHNFRIAR JOHNHoly Franciscan friar! brother, ho!Enter FRIAR LAURENCEFRIAR LAURENCEThis same should be the voice of Friar John.Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.FRIAR JOHNGoing to find a bare-foot brother outOne of our order, to associate me,Here in this city visiting the sick,And finding him, the searchers of the town,Suspecting that we both were in a houseWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.FRIAR LAURENCEWho bare my letter, then, to Romeo?FRIAR JOHNI could not send it,--here it is again,--Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,So fearful were they of infection.FRIAR LAURENCEUnhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,The letter was not nice but full of chargeOf dear import, and the neglecting itMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence;Get me an iron crow, and bring it straightUnto my cell.FRIAR JOHNBrother, I'll go and bring it thee.ExitFRIAR LAURENCENow must I to the monument alone;Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:She will beshrew me much that RomeoHath had no notice of these accidents;But I will write again to Mantua,And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!ExitSCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torchPARISGive me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,As signal that thou hear'st something approach.Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.PAGE[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand aloneHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.RetiresPARISSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:The obsequies that I for thee will keepNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.The Page whistlesThe boy gives warning something doth approach.What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.RetiresEnter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock,  & cROMEOGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.Hold, take this letter; early in the morningSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,And do not interrupt me in my course.Why I descend into this bed of death,Is partly to behold my lady's face;But chiefly to take thence from her dead fingerA precious ring, a ring that I must useIn dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:But if thou, jealous, dost return to pryIn what I further shall intend to do,By heaven, I will tear thee joint by jointAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:The time and my intents are savage-wild,More fierce and more inexorable farThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.BALTHASARI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.ROMEOSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.BALTHASAR[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.RetiresROMEOThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!Opens the tombPARISThis is that banish'd haughty Montague,That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,It is supposed, the fair creature died;And here is come to do some villanous shameTo the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.Comes forwardStop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!Can vengeance be pursued further than death?Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.ROMEOI must indeed; and therefore came I hither.Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,Put not another sin upon my head,By urging me to fury: O, be gone!By heaven, I love thee better than myself;For I come hither arm'd against myself:Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,A madman's mercy bade thee run away.PARISI do defy thy conjurations,And apprehend thee for a felon here.ROMEOWilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!They fightPAGEO Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.ExitPARISO, I am slain!FallsIf thou be merciful,Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.DiesROMEOIn faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!What said my man, when my betossed soulDid not attend him as we rode? I thinkHe told me Paris should have married Juliet:Said he not so? or did I dream it so?Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makesThis vault a feasting presence full of light.Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.Laying PARIS in the tombHow oft when men are at the point of deathHave they been merry! which their keepers callA lightning before death: O, how may ICall this a lightning? O my love! my wife!Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yetIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,And death's pale flag is not advanced there.Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?O, what more favour can I do to thee,Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twainTo sunder his that was thine enemy?Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believeThat unsubstantial death is amorous,And that the lean abhorred monster keepsThee here in dark to be his paramour?For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;And never from this palace of dim nightDepart again: here, here will I remainWith worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, hereWill I set up my everlasting rest,And shake the yoke of inauspicious starsFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O youThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kissA dateless bargain to engrossing death!Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!Thou desperate pilot, now at once run onThe dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!Here's to my love!DrinksO true apothecary!Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.DiesEnter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spadeFRIAR LAURENCESaint Francis be my speed! how oft to-nightHave my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?BALTHASARHere's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.FRIAR LAURENCEBliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,What torch is yond, that vainly lends his lightTo grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,It burneth in the Capel's monument.BALTHASARIt doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,One that you love.FRIAR LAURENCEWho is it?BALTHASARRomeo.FRIAR LAURENCEHow long hath he been there?BALTHASARFull half an hour.FRIAR LAURENCEGo with me to the vault.BALTHASARI dare not, sirMy master knows not but I am gone hence;And fearfully did menace me with death,If I did stay to look on his intents.FRIAR LAURENCEStay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.BALTHASARAs I did sleep under this yew-tree here,I dreamt my master and another fought,And that my master slew him.FRIAR LAURENCERomeo!AdvancesAlack, alack, what blood is this, which stainsThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?What mean these masterless and gory swordsTo lie discolour'd by this place of peace?Enters the tombRomeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hourIs guilty of this lamentable chance!The lady stirs.JULIET wakesJULIETO comfortable friar! where is my lord?I do remember well where I should be,And there I am. Where is my Romeo?Noise withinFRIAR LAURENCEI hear some noise. Lady, come from that nestOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:A greater power than we can contradictHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of theeAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns:Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;Come, go, good Juliet,Noise againI dare no longer stay.JULIETGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.Exit FRIAR LAURENCEWhat's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly dropTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips;Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,To make die with a restorative.Kisses himThy lips are warm.First Watchman[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?JULIETYea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!Snatching ROMEO's daggerThis is thy sheath;Stabs herselfthere rust, and let me die.Falls on ROMEO's body, and diesEnter Watch, with the Page of PARISPAGEThis is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.First WatchmanThe ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,Who here hath lain these two days buried.Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:Raise up the Montagues: some others search:We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;But the true ground of all these piteous woesWe cannot without circumstance descry.Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASARSecond WatchmanHere's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.First WatchmanHold him in safety, till the prince come hither.Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCEThird WatchmanHere is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:We took this mattock and this spade from him,As he was coming from this churchyard side.First WatchmanA great suspicion: stay the friar too.Enter the PRINCE and AttendantsPRINCEWhat misadventure is so early up,That calls our person from our morning's rest?Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and othersCAPULETWhat should it be, that they so shriek abroad?LADY CAPULETThe people in the street cry Romeo,Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,With open outcry toward our monument.PRINCEWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?First WatchmanSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,Warm and new kill'd.PRINCESearch, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.First WatchmanHere is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;With instruments upon them, fit to openThese dead men's tombs.CAPULETO heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his houseIs empty on the back of Montague,--And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!LADY CAPULETO me! this sight of death is as a bell,That warns my old age to a sepulchre.Enter MONTAGUE and othersPRINCECome, Montague; for thou art early up,To see thy son and heir more early down.MONTAGUEAlas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:What further woe conspires against mine age?PRINCELook, and thou shalt see.MONTAGUEO thou untaught! what manners is in this?To press before thy father to a grave?PRINCESeal up the mouth of outrage for a while,Till we can clear these ambiguities,And know their spring, their head, theirtrue descent;And then will I be general of your woes,And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,And let mischance be slave to patience.Bring forth the parties of suspicion.FRIAR LAURENCEI am the greatest, able to do least,Yet most suspected, as the time and placeDoth make against me of this direful murder;And here I stand, both to impeach and purgeMyself condemned and myself excused.PRINCEThen say at once what thou dost know in this.FRIAR LAURENCEI will be brief, for my short date of breathIs not so long as is a tedious tale.Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:I married them; and their stol'n marriage-dayWas Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely deathBanish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.You, to remove that siege of grief from her,Betroth'd and would have married her perforceTo County Paris: then comes she to me,And, with wild looks, bid me devise some meanTo rid her from this second marriage,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,A sleeping potion; which so took effectAs I intended, for it wrought on herThe form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,That he should hither come as this dire night,To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,Being the time the potion's force should cease.But he which bore my letter, Friar John,Was stay'd by accident, and yesternightReturn'd my letter back. Then all aloneAt the prefixed hour of her waking,Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:But when I came, some minute ere the timeOf her awaking, here untimely layThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,And bear this work of heaven with patience:But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;And she, too desperate, would not go with me,But, as it seems, did violence on herself.All this I know; and to the marriageHer nurse is privy: and, if aught in thisMiscarried by my fault, let my old lifeBe sacrificed, some hour before his time,Unto the rigour of severest law.PRINCEWe still have known thee for a holy man.Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?BALTHASARI brought my master news of Juliet's death;And then in post he came from MantuaTo this same place, to this same monument.This letter he early bid me give his father,And threatened me with death, going in the vault,I departed not and left him there.PRINCEGive me the letter; I will look on it.Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?Sirrah, what made your master in this place?PAGEHe came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;And by and by my master drew on him;And then I ran away to call the watch.PRINCEThis letter doth make good the friar's words,Their course of love, the tidings of her death:And here he writes that he did buy a poisonOf a poor 'pothecary, and therewithalCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.And I for winking at your discords tooHave lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.CAPULETO brother Montague, give me thy hand:This is my daughter's jointure, for no moreCan I demand.MONTAGUEBut I can give thee more:For I will raise her statue in pure gold;That while Verona by that name is known,There shall no figure at such rate be setAs that of true and faithful Juliet.CAPULETAs rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;Poor sacrifices of our enmity!PRINCEA glooming peace this morning with it brings;The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:For never was a story of more woeThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.Exeunt
