ACT ISCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.Enter two GentlemenFirst GentlemanYou do not meet a man but frowns: our bloodsNo more obey the heavens than our courtiersStill seem as does the king.Second GentlemanBut what's the matter?First GentlemanHis daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whomHe purposed to his wife's sole son--a widowThat late he married--hath referr'd herselfUnto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: allIs outward sorrow; though I think the kingBe touch'd at very heart.Second GentlemanNone but the king?First GentlemanHe that hath lost her too; so is the queen,That most desired the match; but not a courtier,Although they wear their faces to the bentOf the king's look's, hath a heart that is notGlad at the thing they scowl at.Second GentlemanAnd why so?First GentlemanHe that hath miss'd the princess is a thingToo bad for bad report: and he that hath her--I mean, that married her, alack, good man!And therefore banish'd--is a creature suchAs, to seek through the regions of the earthFor one his like, there would be something failingIn him that should compare. I do not thinkSo fair an outward and such stuff withinEndows a man but he.Second GentlemanYou speak him far.First GentlemanI do extend him, sir, within himself,Crush him together rather than unfoldHis measure duly.Second GentlemanWhat's his name and birth?First GentlemanI cannot delve him to the root: his fatherWas call'd Sicilius, who did join his honourAgainst the Romans with Cassibelan,But had his titles by Tenantius whomHe served with glory and admired success,So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;And had, besides this gentleman in question,Two other sons, who in the wars o' the timeDied with their swords in hand; for whichtheir father,Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrowThat he quit being, and his gentle lady,Big of this gentleman our theme, deceasedAs he was born. The king he takes the babeTo his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,Puts to him all the learnings that his timeCould make him the receiver of; which he took,As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,A sample to the youngest, to the more matureA glass that feated them, and to the graverA child that guided dotards; to his mistress,For whom he now is banish'd, her own priceProclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;By her election may be truly readWhat kind of man he is.Second GentlemanI honour himEven out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,Is she sole child to the king?First GentlemanHis only child.He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nurseryWere stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledgeWhich way they went.Second GentlemanHow long is this ago?First GentlemanSome twenty years.Second GentlemanThat a king's children should be so convey'd,So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,That could not trace them!First GentlemanHowsoe'er 'tis strange,Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,Yet is it true, sir.Second GentlemanI do well believe you.First GentlemanWe must forbear: here comes the gentleman,The queen, and princess.ExeuntEnter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGENQUEENNo, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,After the slander of most stepmothers,Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, butYour gaoler shall deliver you the keysThat lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,So soon as I can win the offended king,I will be known your advocate: marry, yetThe fire of rage is in him, and 'twere goodYou lean'd unto his sentence with what patienceYour wisdom may inform you.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSPlease your highness,I will from hence to-day.QUEENYou know the peril.I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pityingThe pangs of barr'd affections, though the kingHath charged you should not speak together.ExitIMOGENODissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrantCan tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--Always reserved my holy duty--whatHis rage can do on me: you must be gone;And I shall here abide the hourly shotOf angry eyes, not comforted to live,But that there is this jewel in the worldThat I may see again.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSMy queen! my mistress!O lady, weep no more, lest I give causeTo be suspected of more tendernessThan doth become a man. I will remainThe loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:My residence in Rome at one Philario's,Who to my father was a friend, to meKnown but by letter: thither write, my queen,And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,Though ink be made of gall.Re-enter QUEENQUEENBe brief, I pray you:If the king come, I shall incur I know notHow much of his displeasure.AsideYet I'll move himTo walk this way: I never do him wrong,But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;Pays dear for my offences.ExitPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSShould we be taking leaveAs long a term as yet we have to live,The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!IMOGENNay, stay a little:Were you but riding forth to air yourself,Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;But keep it till you woo another wife,When Imogen is dead.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSHow, how! another?You gentle gods, give me but this I have,And sear up my embracements from a nextWith bonds of death!Putting on the ringRemain, remain thou hereWhile sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,As I my poor self did exchange for you,To your so infinite loss, so in our triflesI still win of you: for my sake wear this;It is a manacle of love; I'll place itUpon this fairest prisoner.Putting a bracelet upon her armIMOGENO the gods!When shall we see again?Enter CYMBELINE and LordsPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSAlack, the king!CYMBELINEThou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!If after this command thou fraught the courtWith thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!Thou'rt poison to my blood.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThe gods protect you!And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.ExitIMOGENThere cannot be a pinch in deathMore sharp than this is.CYMBELINEO disloyal thing,That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'stA year's age on me.IMOGENI beseech you, sir,Harm not yourself with your vexationI am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rareSubdues all pangs, all fears.CYMBELINEPast grace? obedience?IMOGENPast hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.CYMBELINEThat mightst have had the sole son of my queen!IMOGENO blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,And did avoid a puttock.CYMBELINEThou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throneA seat for baseness.IMOGENNo; I rather addedA lustre to it.CYMBELINEO thou vile one!IMOGENSir,It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:You bred him as my playfellow, and he isA man worth any woman, overbuys meAlmost the sum he pays.CYMBELINEWhat, art thou mad?IMOGENAlmost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I wereA neat-herd's daughter, and my LeonatusOur neighbour shepherd's son!CYMBELINEThou foolish thing!Re-enter QUEENThey were again together: you have doneNot after our command. Away with her,And pen her up.QUEENBeseech your patience. Peace,Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfortOut of your best advice.CYMBELINENay, let her languishA drop of blood a day; and, being aged,Die of this folly!Exeunt CYMBELINE and LordsQUEENFie! you must give way.Enter PISANIOHere is your servant. How now, sir! What news?PISANIOMy lord your son drew on my master.QUEENHa!No harm, I trust, is done?PISANIOThere might have been,But that my master rather play'd than foughtAnd had no help of anger: they were partedBy gentlemen at hand.QUEENI am very glad on't.IMOGENYour son's my father's friend; he takes his part.To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!I would they were in Afric both together;Myself by with a needle, that I might prickThe goer-back. Why came you from your master?PISANIOOn his command: he would not suffer meTo bring him to the haven; left these notesOf what commands I should be subject to,When 't pleased you to employ me.QUEENThis hath beenYour faithful servant: I dare lay mine honourHe will remain so.PISANIOI humbly thank your highness.QUEENPray, walk awhile.IMOGENAbout some half-hour hence,I pray you, speak with me: you shall at leastGo see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.ExeuntSCENE II. The same. A public place.Enter CLOTEN and two LordsFirst LordSir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; theviolence of action hath made you reek as asacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.CLOTENIf my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?Second Lord[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.First LordHurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he benot hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.Second Lord[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' thebackside the town.CLOTENThe villain would not stand me.Second Lord[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.First LordStand you! You have land enough of your own: buthe added to your having; gave you some ground.Second Lord[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!CLOTENI would they had not come between us.Second Lord[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how longa fool you were upon the ground.CLOTENAnd that she should love this fellow and refuse me!Second Lord[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, sheis damned.First LordSir, as I told you always, her beauty and her braingo not together: she's a good sign, but I have seensmall reflection of her wit.Second Lord[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest thereflection should hurt her.CLOTENCome, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been somehurt done!Second Lord[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fallof an ass, which is no great hurt.CLOTENYou'll go with us?First LordI'll attend your lordship.CLOTENNay, come, let's go together.Second LordWell, my lord.ExeuntSCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.Enter IMOGEN and PISANIOIMOGENI would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,And question'dst every sail: if he should writeAnd not have it, 'twere a paper lost,As offer'd mercy is. What was the lastThat he spake to thee?PISANIOIt was his queen, his queen!IMOGENThen waved his handkerchief?PISANIOAnd kiss'd it, madam.IMOGENSenseless Linen! happier therein than I!And that was all?PISANIONo, madam; for so longAs he could make me with this eye or earDistinguish him from others, he did keepThe deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mindCould best express how slow his soul sail'd on,How swift his ship.IMOGENThou shouldst have made himAs little as a crow, or less, ere leftTo after-eye him.PISANIOMadam, so I did.IMOGENI would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, butTo look upon him, till the diminutionOf space had pointed him sharp as my needle,Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted fromThe smallness of a gnat to air, and thenHave turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,When shall we hear from him?PISANIOBe assured, madam,With his next vantage.IMOGENI did not take my leave of him, but hadMost pretty things to say: ere I could tell himHow I would think on him at certain hoursSuch thoughts and such, or I could make him swearThe shes of Italy should not betrayMine interest and his honour, or have charged him,At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,To encounter me with orisons, for thenI am in heaven for him; or ere I couldGive him that parting kiss which I had setBetwixt two charming words, comes in my fatherAnd like the tyrannous breathing of the northShakes all our buds from growing.Enter a LadyLadyThe queen, madam,Desires your highness' company.IMOGENThose things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.I will attend the queen.PISANIOMadam, I shall.ExeuntSCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a SpaniardIACHIMOBelieve it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he wasthen of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthyas since he hath been allowed the name of; but Icould then have looked on him without the help ofadmiration, though the catalogue of his endowmentshad been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.PHILARIOYou speak of him when he was less furnished than nowhe is with that which makes him both without and within.FrenchmanI have seen him in France: we had very many therecould behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.IACHIMOThis matter of marrying his king's daughter, whereinhe must be weighed rather by her value than his own,words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.FrenchmanAnd then his banishment.IACHIMOAy, and the approbation of those that weep thislamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfullyto extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,which else an easy battery might lay flat, fortaking a beggar without less quality. But how comesit he is to sojourn with you? How creepsacquaintance?PHILARIOHis father and I were soldiers together; to whom Ihave been often bound for no less than my life.Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertainedamongst you as suits, with gentlemen of yourknowing, to a stranger of his quality.Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI beseech you all, be better known to thisgentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friendof mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appearhereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.FrenchmanSir, we have known together in Orleans.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSSince when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.FrenchmanSir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad Idid atone my countryman and you; it had been pityyou should have been put together with so mortal apurpose as then each bore, upon importance of soslight and trivial a nature.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSBy your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;rather shunned to go even with what I heard than inmy every action to be guided by others' experiences:but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to sayit is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.Frenchman'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,and by such two that would by all likelihood haveconfounded one the other, or have fallen both.IACHIMOCan we, with manners, ask what was the difference?FrenchmanSafely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.It was much like an argument that fell out lastnight, where each of us fell in praise of ourcountry mistresses; this gentleman at that timevouching--and upon warrant of bloodyaffirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptablethan any the rarest of our ladies in France.IACHIMOThat lady is not now living, or this gentleman'sopinion by this worn out.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSShe holds her virtue still and I my mind.IACHIMOYou must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSBeing so far provoked as I was in France, I wouldabate her nothing, though I profess myself heradorer, not her friend.IACHIMOAs fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-handcomparison--had been something too fair and too goodfor any lady in Britain. If she went before othersI have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustresmany I have beheld. I could not but believe sheexcelled many: but I have not seen the mostprecious diamond that is, nor you the lady.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.IACHIMOWhat do you esteem it at?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSMore than the world enjoys.IACHIMOEither your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she'soutprized by a trifle.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYou are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, ifthere were wealth enough for the purchase, or meritfor the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,and only the gift of the gods.IACHIMOWhich the gods have given you?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSWhich, by their graces, I will keep.IACHIMOYou may wear her in title yours: but, you know,strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Yourring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizableestimations; the one is but frail and the othercasual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplishedcourtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYour Italy contains none so accomplished a courtierto convince the honour of my mistress, if, in theholding or loss of that, you term her frail. I donothing doubt you have store of thieves;notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.PHILARIOLet us leave here, gentlemen.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSSir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, Ithank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.IACHIMOWith five times so much conversation, I should getground of your fair mistress, make her go back, evento the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSNo, no.IACHIMOI dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate toyour ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues itsomething: but I make my wager rather against yourconfidence than her reputation: and, to bar youroffence herein too, I durst attempt it against anylady in the world.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYou are a great deal abused in too bold apersuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you'reworthy of by your attempt.IACHIMOWhat's that?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSA repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,deserve more; a punishment too.PHILARIOGentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, bebetter acquainted.IACHIMOWould I had put my estate and my neighbour's on theapprobation of what I have spoke!POSTHUMUS LEONATUSWhat lady would you choose to assail?IACHIMOYours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,that, commend me to the court where your lady is,with no more advantage than the opportunity of asecond conference, and I will bring from thencethat honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ringI hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.IACHIMOYou are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buyladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannotpreserve it from tainting: but I see you have somereligion in you, that you fear.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThis is but a custom in your tongue; you bear agraver purpose, I hope.IACHIMOI am the master of my speeches, and would undergowhat's spoken, I swear.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSWill you? I shall but lend my diamond till yourreturn: let there be covenants drawn between's: mymistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of yourunworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.PHILARIOI will have it no lay.IACHIMOBy the gods, it is one. If I bring you nosufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearestbodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducatsare yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold areyours: provided I have your commendation for my morefree entertainment.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI embrace these conditions; let us have articlesbetwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: ifyou make your voyage upon her and give me directlyto understand you have prevailed, I am no furtheryour enemy; she is not worth our debate: if sheremain unseduced, you not making it appearotherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault youhave made to her chastity you shall answer me withyour sword.IACHIMOYour hand; a covenant: we will have these things setdown by lawful counsel, and straight away forBritain, lest the bargain should catch cold andstarve: I will fetch my gold and have our twowagers recorded.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSAgreed.Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMOFrenchmanWill this hold, think you?PHILARIOSignior Iachimo will not from it.Pray, let us follow 'em.ExeuntSCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUSQUEENWhiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;Make haste: who has the note of them?First LadyI, madam.QUEENDispatch.Exeunt LadiesNow, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?CORNELIUSPleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:Presenting a small boxBut I beseech your grace, without offence,--My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you haveCommanded of me those most poisonous compounds,Which are the movers of a languishing death;But though slow, deadly?QUEENI wonder, doctor,Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not beenThy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me howTo make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, soThat our great king himself doth woo me oftFor my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meetThat I did amplify my judgment inOther conclusions? I will try the forcesOf these thy compounds on such creatures asWe count not worth the hanging, but none human,To try the vigour of them and applyAllayments to their act, and by them gatherTheir several virtues and effects.CORNELIUSYour highnessShall from this practise but make hard your heart:Besides, the seeing these effects will beBoth noisome and infectious.QUEENO, content thee.Enter PISANIOAsideHere comes a flattering rascal; upon himWill I first work: he's for his master,An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!Doctor, your service for this time is ended;Take your own way.CORNELIUS[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam;But you shall do no harm.QUEEN[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.CORNELIUS[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she hasStrange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,And will not trust one of her malice withA drug of such damn'd nature. Those she hasWill stupefy and dull the sense awhile;Which first, perchance, she'll prove oncats and dogs,Then afterward up higher: but there isNo danger in what show of death it makes,More than the locking-up the spirits a time,To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'dWith a most false effect; and I the truer,So to be false with her.QUEENNo further service, doctor,Until I send for thee.CORNELIUSI humbly take my leave.ExitQUEENWeeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in timeShe will not quench and let instructions enterWhere folly now possesses? Do thou work:When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,I'll tell thee on the instant thou art thenAs great as is thy master, greater, forHis fortunes all lie speechless and his nameIs at last gasp: return he cannot, norContinue where he is: to shift his beingIs to exchange one misery with another,And every day that comes comes to decayA day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,To be depender on a thing that leans,Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,So much as but to prop him?The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it upThou takest upThou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:It is a thing I made, which hath the kingFive times redeem'd from death: I do not knowWhat is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;It is an earnest of a further goodThat I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress howThe case stands with her; do't as from thyself.Think what a chance thou changest on, but thinkThou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the kingTo any shape of thy preferment suchAs thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,That set thee on to this desert, am boundTo load thy merit richly. Call my women:Think on my words.Exit PISANIOA sly and constant knave,Not to be shaked; the agent for his masterAnd the remembrancer of her to holdThe hand-fast to her lord. I have given him thatWhich, if he take, shall quite unpeople herOf liegers for her sweet, and which she after,Except she bend her humour, shall be assuredTo taste of too.Re-enter PISANIO and LadiesSo, so: well done, well done:The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;Think on my words.Exeunt QUEEN and LadiesPISANIOAnd shall do:But when to my good lord I prove untrue,I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.ExitSCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.Enter IMOGENIMOGENA father cruel, and a step-dame false;A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!My supreme crown of grief! and those repeatedVexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,As my two brothers, happy! but most miserableIs the desire that's glorious: blest be those,How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!Enter PISANIO and IACHIMOPISANIOMadam, a noble gentleman of Rome,Comes from my lord with letters.IACHIMOChange you, madam?The worthy Leonatus is in safetyAnd greets your highness dearly.Presents a letterIMOGENThanks, good sir:You're kindly welcome.IACHIMO[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,She is alone the Arabian bird, and IHave lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;Rather directly fly.IMOGEN[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whosekindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect uponhim accordingly, as you value your trust--LEONATUS.'So far I read aloud:But even the very middle of my heartIs warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.You are as welcome, worthy sir, as IHave words to bid you, and shall find it soIn all that I can do.IACHIMOThanks, fairest lady.What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyesTo see this vaulted arch, and the rich cropOf sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixtThe fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stonesUpon the number'd beach? and can we notPartition make with spectacles so precious'Twixt fair and foul?IMOGENWhat makes your admiration?IACHIMOIt cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way andContemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,For idiots in this case of favour wouldBe wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;Sluttery to such neat excellence opposedShould make desire vomit emptiness,Not so allured to feed.IMOGENWhat is the matter, trow?IACHIMOThe cloyed will,That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tubBoth fill'd and running, ravening first the lambLongs after for the garbage.IMOGENWhat, dear sir,Thus raps you? Are you well?IACHIMOThanks, madam; well.To PISANIOBeseech you, sir, desireMy man's abode where I did leave him: heIs strange and peevish.PISANIOI was going, sir,To give him welcome.ExitIMOGENContinues well my lord? His health, beseech you?IACHIMOWell, madam.IMOGENIs he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.IACHIMOExceeding pleasant; none a stranger thereSo merry and so gamesome: he is call'dThe Briton reveller.IMOGENWhen he was here,He did incline to sadness, and oft-timesNot knowing why.IACHIMOI never saw him sad.There is a Frenchman his companion, oneAn eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much lovesA Gallian girl at home; he furnacesThe thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knowsBy history, report, or his own proof,What woman is, yea, what she cannot chooseBut must be, will his free hours languish forAssured bondage?'IMOGENWill my lord say so?IACHIMOAy, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:It is a recreation to be byAnd hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,Some men are much to blame.IMOGENNot he, I hope.IACHIMONot he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him mightBe used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;In you, which I account his beyond all talents,Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am boundTo pity too.IMOGENWhat do you pity, sir?IACHIMOTwo creatures heartily.IMOGENAm I one, sir?You look on me: what wreck discern you in meDeserves your pity?IACHIMOLamentable! What,To hide me from the radiant sun and solaceI' the dungeon by a snuff?IMOGENI pray you, sir,Deliver with more openness your answersTo my demands. Why do you pity me?IACHIMOThat others do--I was about to say--enjoy your--ButIt is an office of the gods to venge it,Not mine to speak on 't.IMOGENYou do seem to knowSomething of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--Since doubling things go ill often hurts moreThan to be sure they do; for certaintiesEither are past remedies, or, timely knowing,The remedy then born--discover to meWhat both you spur and stop.IACHIMOHad I this cheekTo bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soulTo the oath of loyalty; this object, whichTakes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,Slaver with lips as common as the stairsThat mount the Capitol; join gripes with handsMade hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, asWith labour; then by-peeping in an eyeBase and unlustrous as the smoky lightThat's fed with stinking tallow; it were fitThat all the plagues of hell should at one timeEncounter such revolt.IMOGENMy lord, I fear,Has forgot Britain.IACHIMOAnd himself. Not I,Inclined to this intelligence, pronounceThe beggary of his change; but 'tis your gracesThat from pay mutest conscience to my tongueCharms this report out.IMOGENLet me hear no more.IACHIMOO dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heartWith pity, that doth make me sick. A ladySo fair, and fasten'd to an empery,Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'dWith tomboys hired with that self-exhibitionWhich your own coffers yield! with diseased venturesThat play with all infirmities for goldWhich rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuffAs well might poison poison! Be revenged;Or she that bore you was no queen, and youRecoil from your great stock.IMOGENRevenged!How should I be revenged? If this be true,--As I have such a heart that both mine earsMust not in haste abuse--if it be true,How should I be revenged?IACHIMOShould he make meLive, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,More noble than that runagate to your bed,And will continue fast to your affection,Still close as sure.IMOGENWhat, ho, Pisanio!IACHIMOLet me my service tender on your lips.IMOGENAway! I do condemn mine ears that haveSo long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, notFor such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as farFrom thy report as thou from honour, andSolicit'st here a lady that disdainsThee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!The king my father shall be made acquaintedOf thy assault: if he shall think it fit,A saucy stranger in his court to martAs in a Romish stew and to expoundHis beastly mind to us, he hath a courtHe little cares for and a daughter whoHe not respects at all.

Cytherea,How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing thatPerfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taperBows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,To see the enclosed lights, now canopiedUnder these windows, white and azure lacedWith blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,To note the chamber: I will write all down:Such and such pictures; there the window; suchThe adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.Ah, but some natural notes about her body,Above ten thousand meaner moveablesWould testify, to enrich mine inventory.O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!And be her sense but as a monument,Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:Taking off her braceletAs slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,As strongly as the conscience does within,To the madding of her lord. On her left breastA mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson dropsI' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,Stronger than ever law could make: this secretWill force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'enThe treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?Why should I write this down, that's riveted,Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading lateThe tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd downWhere Philomel gave up. I have enough:To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawningMay bare the raven's eye!

If this penetrate, I willconsider your music the better: if it do not, it isa vice in her ears, which horse-hairs andcalves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch toboot, can never amend.Exeunt MusiciansSecond LordHere comes the king.CLOTENI am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason Iwas up so early: he cannot choose but take thisservice I have done fatherly.Enter CYMBELINE and QUEENGood morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.CYMBELINEAttend you here the door of our stern daughter?Will she not forth?CLOTENI have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.CYMBELINEThe exile of her minion is too new;She hath not yet forgot him: some more timeMust wear the print of his remembrance out,And then she's yours.QUEENYou are most bound to the king,Who lets go by no vantages that mayPrefer you to his daughter.

A hall in Cymbeline's palace.Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,  and Lords at one door, and at another, CAIUS LUCIUS and AttendantsCYMBELINENow say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?CAIUS LUCIUSWhen Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yetLives in men's eyes and will to ears and tonguesBe theme and hearing ever, was in this BritainAnd conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit lessThan in his feats deserving it--for himAnd his succession granted Rome a tribute,Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee latelyIs left untender'd.QUEENAnd, to kill the marvel,Shall be so ever.CLOTENThere be many Caesars,Ere such another Julius. Britain isA world by itself; and we will nothing payFor wearing our own noses.QUEENThat opportunityWhich then they had to take from 's, to resumeWe have again. Remember, sir, my liege,The kings your ancestors, together withThe natural bravery of your isle, which standsAs Neptune's park, ribbed and paled inWith rocks unscalable and roaring waters,With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquestCaesar made here; but made not here his bragOf 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--That first that ever touch'd him--he was carriedFrom off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'dAs easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereofThe famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires brightAnd Britons strut with courage.CLOTENCome, there's no more tribute to be paid: ourkingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other ofthem may have crook'd noses, but to owe suchstraight arms, none.CYMBELINESon, let your mother end.CLOTENWe have yet many among us can gripe as hard asCassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have ahand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? IfCaesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, orput the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tributefor light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.CYMBELINEYou must know,Till the injurious Romans did extortThis tribute from us, we were free:Caesar's ambition,Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretchThe sides o' the world, against all colour hereDid put the yoke upon 's; which to shake offBecomes a warlike people, whom we reckonOurselves to be.CLOTENLordsWe do.CYMBELINESay, then, to Caesar,Our ancestor was that Mulmutius whichOrdain'd our laws, whose use the sword of CaesarHath too much mangled; whose repair and franchiseShall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,Who was the first of Britain which did putHis brows within a golden crown and call'dHimself a king.CAIUS LUCIUSI am sorry, Cymbeline,That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--Caesar, that hath more kings his servants thanThyself domestic officers--thine enemy:Receive it from me, then: war and confusionIn Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: lookFor fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,I thank thee for myself.CYMBELINEThou art welcome, Caius.Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spentMuch under him; of him I gather'd honour;Which he to seek of me again, perforce,Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfectThat the Pannonians and Dalmatians forTheir liberties are now in arms; a precedentWhich not to read would show the Britons cold:So Caesar shall not find them.CAIUS LUCIUSLet proof speak.CLOTENHis majesty bids you welcome. Makepastime with us a day or two, or longer: ifyou seek us afterwards in other terms, youshall find us in our salt-water girdle: if youbeat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall inthe adventure, our crows shall fare the betterfor you; and there's an end.CAIUS LUCIUSSo, sir.CYMBELINEI know your master's pleasure and he mine:All the remain is 'Welcome!'ExeuntSCENE II.

No:She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaultsAs would take in some virtue. O my master!Thy mind to her is now as low as wereThy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?Upon the love and truth and vows which IHave made to thy command? I, her? her blood?If it be so to do good service, neverLet me be counted serviceable.

Prithee, speak,How many score of miles may we well ride'Twixt hour and hour?PISANIOOne score 'twixt sun and sun,Madam, 's enough for you:Asideand too much too.IMOGENWhy, one that rode to's execution, man,Could never go so slow: I have heard ofriding wagers,Where horses have been nimbler than the sandsThat run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:Go bid my woman feign a sickness; sayShe'll home to her father: and provide me presentlyA riding-suit, no costlier than would fitA franklin's housewife.PISANIOMadam, you're best consider.IMOGENI see before me, man: nor here, nor here,Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,Accessible is none but Milford way.ExeuntSCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS followingBELARIUSA goodly day not to keep house, with suchWhose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gateInstructs you how to adore the heavens and bows youTo a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchsAre arch'd so high that giants may jet throughAnd keep their impious turbans on, withoutGood morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardlyAs prouder livers do.GUIDERIUSHail, heaven!ARVIRAGUSHail, heaven!BELARIUSNow for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,When you above perceive me like a crow,That it is place which lessens and sets off;And you may then revolve what tales I have told youOf courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:This service is not service, so being done,But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,Draws us a profit from all things we see;And often, to our comfort, shall we findThe sharded beetle in a safer holdThan is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this lifeIs nobler than attending for a cheque,Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.GUIDERIUSOut of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know notWhat air's from home. Haply this life is best,If quiet life be best; sweeter to youThat have a sharper known; well correspondingWith your stiff age: but unto us it isA cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;A prison for a debtor, that not daresTo stride a limit.ARVIRAGUSWhat should we speak ofWhen we are old as you? when we shall hearThe rain and wind beat dark December, how,In this our pinching cave, shall we discourseThe freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;Our valour is to chase what flies; our cageWe make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,And sing our bondage freely.BELARIUSHow you speak!Did you but know the city's usuriesAnd felt them knowingly; the art o' the courtAs hard to leave as keep; whose top to climbIs certain falling, or so slippery thatThe fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,A pain that only seems to seek out dangerI' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'the search,And hath as oft a slanderous epitaphAs record of fair act; nay, many times,Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this storyThe world may read in me: my body's mark'dWith Roman swords, and my report was onceFirst with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,And when a soldier was the theme, my nameWas not far off: then was I as a treeWhose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,A storm or robbery, call it what you will,Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,And left me bare to weather.GUIDERIUSUncertain favour!BELARIUSMy fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'dBefore my perfect honour, swore to CymbelineI was confederate with the Romans: soFollow'd my banishment, and this twenty yearsThis rock and these demesnes have been my world;Where I have lived at honest freedom, paidMore pious debts to heaven than in allThe fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!This is not hunters' language: he that strikesThe venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;To him the other two shall minister;And we will fear no poison, which attendsIn place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUSHow hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!These boys know little they are sons to the king;Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.They think they are mine; and though train'dup thus meanlyI' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hitThe roofs of palaces, and nature prompts themIn simple and low things to prince it muchBeyond the trick of others. This Polydore,The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, whoThe king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!When on my three-foot stool I sit and tellThe warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly outInto my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even thenThe princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,Strains his young nerves and puts himself in postureThat acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,Strikes life into my speech and shows much moreHis own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knowsThou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,At three and two years old, I stole these babes;Thinking to bar thee of succession, asThou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,Thou wast their nurse; they took thee fortheir mother,And every day do honour to her grave:Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,They take for natural father. The game is up.ExitSCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.Enter PISANIO and IMOGENIMOGENThou told'st me, when we came from horse, the placeWas near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother soTo see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sighFrom the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,Would be interpreted a thing perplex'dBeyond self-explication: put thyselfInto a havior of less fear, ere wildnessVanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?Why tender'st thou that paper to me, withA look untender? If't be summer news,Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'stBut keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongueMay take off some extremity, which to readWould be even mortal to me.PISANIOPlease you, read;And you shall find me, wretched man, a thingThe most disdain'd of fortune.IMOGEN[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played thestrumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof liebleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,but from proof as strong as my grief and as certainas I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted withthe breach of hers. Let thine own hands take awayher life: I shall give thee opportunity atMilford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purposewhere, if thou fear to strike and to make me certainit is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour andequally to me disloyal.'PISANIOWhat shall I need to draw my sword? the paperHath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongueOutvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breathRides on the posting winds and doth belieAll corners of the world: kings, queens and states,Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the graveThis viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?IMOGENFalse to his bed! What is it to be false?To lie in watch there and to think on him?To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleepcharge nature,To break it with a fearful dream of himAnd cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?PISANIOAlas, good lady!IMOGENI false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinksThy favour's good enough. Some jay of ItalyWhose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thoughtPut on for villany; not born where't grows,But worn a bait for ladies.PISANIOGood madam, hear me.IMOGENTrue honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weepingDid scandal many a holy tear, took pityFrom most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjuredFrom thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,A little witness my obedience: look!I draw the sword myself: take it, and hitThe innocent mansion of my love, my heart;Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;Thy master is not there, who was indeedThe riches of it: do his bidding; strikeThou mayst be valiant in a better cause;But now thou seem'st a coward.PISANIOHence, vile instrument!Thou shalt not damn my hand.IMOGENWhy, I must die;And if I do not by thy hand, thou artNo servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughterThere is a prohibition so divineThat cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,Corrupters of my faith! you shall no moreBe stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor foolsBelieve false teachers: though those thatare betray'dDo feel the treason sharply, yet the traitorStands in worse case of woe.And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set upMy disobedience 'gainst the king my fatherAnd make me put into contempt the suitsOf princely fellows, shalt hereafter findIt is no act of common passage, butA strain of rareness: and I grieve myselfTo think, when thou shalt be disedged by herThat now thou tirest on, how thy memoryWill then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,When I desire it too.PISANIOO gracious lady,Since I received command to do this businessI have not slept one wink.IMOGENDo't, and to bed then.PISANIOI'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.IMOGENWherefore thenDidst undertake it? Why hast thou abusedSo many miles with a pretence? this place?Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,For my being absent? whereunto I neverPurpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,The elected deer before thee?PISANIOBut to win timeTo lose so bad employment; in the whichI have consider'd of a course. Good lady,Hear me with patience.IMOGENTalk thy tongue weary; speakI have heard I am a strumpet; and mine earTherein false struck, can take no greater wound,Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.PISANIOThen, madam,I thought you would not back again.IMOGENMost like;Bringing me here to kill me.PISANIONot so, neither:But if I were as wise as honest, thenMy purpose would prove well. It cannot beBut that my master is abused:Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.Hath done you both this cursed injury.IMOGENSome Roman courtezan.PISANIONo, on my life.I'll give but notice you are dead and send himSome bloody sign of it; for 'tis commandedI should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,And that will well confirm it.IMOGENWhy good fellow,What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?Or in my life what comfort, when I amDead to my husband?PISANIOIf you'll back to the court--IMOGENNo court, no father; nor no more adoWith that harsh, noble, simple nothing,That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to meAs fearful as a siege.PISANIOIf not at court,Then not in Britain must you bide.IMOGENWhere thenHath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volumeOur Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, thinkThere's livers out of Britain.PISANIOI am most gladYou think of other place. The ambassador,Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-HavenTo-morrow: now, if you could wear a mindDark as your fortune is, and but disguiseThat which, to appear itself, must not yet beBut by self-danger, you should tread a coursePretty and full of view; yea, haply, nearThe residence of Posthumus; so nigh at leastThat though his actions were not visible, yetReport should render him hourly to your earAs truly as he moves.IMOGENO, for such means!Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,I would adventure.PISANIOWell, then, here's the point:You must forget to be a woman; changeCommand into obedience: fear and niceness--The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy andAs quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you mustForget that rarest treasure of your cheek,Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touchOf common-kissing Titan, and forgetYour laboursome and dainty trims, whereinYou made great Juno angry.IMOGENNay, be briefI see into thy end, and am almostA man already.PISANIOFirst, make yourself but like one.Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, allThat answer to them: would you in their serving,And with what imitation you can borrowFrom youth of such a season, 'fore noble LuciusPresent yourself, desire his service, tell himwherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,If that his head have ear in music,--doubtlessWith joy he will embrace you, for he's honourableAnd doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,You have me, rich; and I will never failBeginning nor supplyment.IMOGENThou art all the comfortThe gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:There's more to be consider'd; but we'll evenAll that good time will give us: this attemptI am soldier to, and will abide it withA prince's courage. Away, I prithee.PISANIOWell, madam, we must take a short farewell,Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected ofYour carriage from the court. My noble mistress,Here is a box; I had it from the queen:What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of thisWill drive away distemper.

Happiness!Exeunt LUCIUS and LordsQUEENHe goes hence frowning: but it honours usThat we have given him cause.CLOTEN'Tis all the better;Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.CYMBELINELucius hath wrote already to the emperorHow it goes here. It fits us therefore ripelyOur chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:The powers that he already hath in GalliaWill soon be drawn to head, from whence he movesHis war for Britain.QUEEN'Tis not sleepy business;But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.CYMBELINEOur expectation that it would be thusHath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'dBefore the Roman, nor to us hath tender'dThe duty of the day: she looks us likeA thing more made of malice than of duty:We have noted it. Call her before us; forWe have been too slight in sufferance.Exit an AttendantQUEENRoyal sir,Since the exile of Posthumus, most retiredHath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,'Tis time must do.

HowCan her contempt be answer'd?AttendantPlease you, sir,Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answerThat will be given to the loudest noise we make.QUEENMy lord, when last I went to visit her,She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,She should that duty leave unpaid to you,Which daily she was bound to proffer: thisShe wish'd me to make known; but our great courtMade me to blame in memory.CYMBELINEHer doors lock'd?Not seen of late?

But for her,Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flownTo her desired Posthumus: gone she isTo death or to dishonour; and my endCan make good use of either: she being down,I have the placing of the British crown.Re-enter CLOTENHow now, my son!CLOTEN'Tis certain she is fled.Go in and cheer the king: he rages; noneDare come about him.QUEEN[Aside]            All the better: mayThis night forestall him of the coming day!ExitCLOTENI love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisiteThan lady, ladies, woman; from every oneThe best she hath, and she, of all compounded,Outsells them all; I love her therefore: butDisdaining me and throwing favours onThe low Posthumus slanders so her judgmentThat what's else rare is choked; and in that pointI will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--Enter PISANIOWho is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,Where is thy lady? In a word; or elseThou art straightway with the fiends.PISANIOO, good my lord!CLOTENWhere is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--I will not ask again. Close villain,I'll have this secret from thy heart, or ripThy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?From whose so many weights of baseness cannotA dram of worth be drawn.PISANIOAlas, my lord,How can she be with him? When was she missed?He is in Rome.CLOTENWhere is she, sir? Come nearer;No further halting: satisfy me homeWhat is become of her.PISANIOO, my all-worthy lord!CLOTENAll-worthy villain!Discover where thy mistress is at once,At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'Speak, or thy silence on the instant isThy condemnation and thy death.PISANIOThen, sir,This paper is the history of my knowledgeTouching her flight.Presenting a letterCLOTENLet's see't. I will pursue herEven to Augustus' throne.PISANIO[Aside]                 Or this, or perish.She's far enough; and what he learns by thisMay prove his travel, not her danger.CLOTENHum!PISANIO[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!CLOTENSirrah, is this letter true?PISANIOSir, as I think.CLOTENIt is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thouwouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,undergo those employments wherein I should havecause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform itdirectly and truly, I would think thee an honestman: thou shouldst neither want my means for thyrelief nor my voice for thy preferment.PISANIOWell, my good lord.CLOTENWilt thou serve me? for since patiently andconstantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune ofthat beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in thecourse of gratitude, but be a diligent follower ofmine: wilt thou serve me?PISANIOSir, I will.CLOTENGive me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thylate master's garments in thy possession?PISANIOI have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit hewore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.CLOTENThe first service thou dost me, fetch that suithither: let it be thy lint service; go.PISANIOI shall, my lord.ExitCLOTENMeet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him onething; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thouvillain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would thesegarments were come. She said upon a time--thebitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that sheheld the very garment of Posthumus in more respectthan my noble and natural person together with theadornment of my qualities. With that suit upon myback, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in hereyes; there shall she see my valour, which will thenbe a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, myspeech of insultment ended on his dead body, andwhen my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vexher I will execute in the clothes that she sopraised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foother home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,and I'll be merry in my revenge.Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothesBe those the garments?PISANIOAy, my noble lord.CLOTENHow long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?PISANIOShe can scarce be there yet.CLOTENBring this apparel to my chamber; that is the secondthing that I have commanded thee: the third is,that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Bebut duteous, and true preferment shall tender itselfto thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I hadwings to follow it! Come, and be true.ExitPISANIOThou bid'st me to my loss: for true to theeWere to prove false, which I will never be,To him that is most true. To Milford go,And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speedBe cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!ExitSCENE VI. Wales.

I should be sick,But that my resolution helps me. Milford,When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I thinkFoundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told meI could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tisA punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulnessIs sorer than to lie for need, and falsehoodIs worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,My hunger's gone; but even before, I wasAt point to sink for food. But what is this?Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:I were best not to call; I dare not call:yet famine,Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness everOf hardiness is mother.

What mortality is!Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thyshoulders, shall within this hour be off; thymistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces beforethy face: and all this done, spurn her home to herfather; who may haply be a little angry for my sorough usage; but my mother, having power of histestiness, shall turn all into my commendations.

I am ill, but your being by meCannot amend me; society is no comfortTo one not sociable: I am not very sick,Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,Stealing so poorly.GUIDERIUSI love thee; I have spoke itHow much the quantity, the weight as much,As I do love my father.BELARIUSWhat! how! how!ARVIRAGUSIf it be sin to say so, I yoke meIn my good brother's fault: I know not whyI love this youth; and I have heard you say,Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say'My father, not this youth.'BELARIUS[Aside]	O noble strain!O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.I'm not their father; yet who this should be,Doth miracle itself, loved before me.'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.ARVIRAGUSBrother, farewell.IMOGENI wish ye sport.ARVIRAGUSYou health. So please you, sir.IMOGEN[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods, what liesI have heard!Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:Experience, O, thou disprovest report!The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dishPoor tributary rivers as sweet fish.I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,I'll now taste of thy drug.Swallows someGUIDERIUSI could not stir him:He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.ARVIRAGUSThus did he answer me: yet said, hereafterI might know more.BELARIUSTo the field, to the field!We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.ARVIRAGUSWe'll not be long away.BELARIUSPray, be not sick,For you must be our housewife.IMOGENWell or ill,I am bound to you.BELARIUSAnd shalt be ever.Exit IMOGEN, to the caveThis youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath hadGood ancestors.ARVIRAGUSHow angel-like he sings!GUIDERIUSBut his neat cookery! he cut our rootsIn characters,And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sickAnd he her dieter.ARVIRAGUSNobly he yokesA smiling with a sigh, as if the sighWas that it was, for not being such a smile;The smile mocking the sigh, that it would flyFrom so divine a temple, to commixWith winds that sailors rail at.GUIDERIUSI do noteThat grief and patience, rooted in him both,Mingle their spurs together.ARVIRAGUSGrow, patience!And let the stinking elder, grief, untwineHis perishing root with the increasing vine!BELARIUSIt is great morning. Come, away!--Who's there?Enter CLOTENCLOTENI cannot find those runagates; that villainHath mock'd me. I am faint.BELARIUS'Those runagates!'Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tisCloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.I saw him not these many years, and yetI know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!GUIDERIUSHe is but one: you and my brother searchWhat companies are near: pray you, away;Let me alone with him.Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUSCLOTENSoft! What are youThat fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?I have heard of such. What slave art thou?GUIDERIUSA thingMore slavish did I ne'er than answeringA slave without a knock.CLOTENThou art a robber,A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.GUIDERIUSTo who? to thee? What art thou? Have not IAn arm as big as thine? a heart as big?Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear notMy dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,Why I should yield to thee?CLOTENThou villain base,Know'st me not by my clothes?GUIDERIUSNo, nor thy tailor, rascal,Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,Which, as it seems, make thee.CLOTENThou precious varlet,My tailor made them not.GUIDERIUSHence, then, and thankThe man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;I am loath to beat thee.CLOTENThou injurious thief,Hear but my name, and tremble.GUIDERIUSWhat's thy name?CLOTENCloten, thou villain.GUIDERIUSCloten, thou double villain, be thy name,I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, orAdder, Spider,'Twould move me sooner.CLOTENTo thy further fear,Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt knowI am son to the queen.GUIDERIUSI am sorry for 't; not seemingSo worthy as thy birth.CLOTENArt not afeard?GUIDERIUSThose that I reverence those I fear, the wise:At fools I laugh, not fear them.CLOTENDie the death:When I have slain thee with my proper hand,I'll follow those that even now fled hence,And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:Yield, rustic mountaineer.Exeunt, fightingRe-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUSBELARIUSNo companies abroad?ARVIRAGUSNone in the world: you did mistake him, sure.BELARIUSI cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favourWhich then he wore; the snatches in his voice,And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute'Twas very Cloten.ARVIRAGUSIn this place we left them:I wish my brother make good time with him,You say he is so fell.BELARIUSBeing scarce made up,I mean, to man, he had not apprehensionOf roaring terrors; for the effect of judgmentIs oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S headGUIDERIUSThis Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;There was no money in't: not HerculesCould have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:Yet I not doing this, the fool had borneMy head as I do his.BELARIUSWhat hast thou done?GUIDERIUSI am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,Son to the queen, after his own report;Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and sworeWith his own single hand he'ld take us inDisplace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,And set them on Lud's-town.BELARIUSWe are all undone.GUIDERIUSWhy, worthy father, what have we to lose,But that he swore to take, our lives? The lawProtects not us: then why should we be tenderTo let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,Play judge and executioner all himself,For we do fear the law? What companyDiscover you abroad?BELARIUSNo single soulCan we set eye on; but in all safe reasonHe must have some attendants. Though his humourWas nothing but mutation, ay, and thatFrom one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, notAbsolute madness could so far have ravedTo bring him here alone; although perhapsIt may be heard at court that such as weCave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in timeMay make some stronger head; the which he hearing--As it is like him--might break out, and swearHe'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probableTo come alone, either he so undertaking,Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,If we do fear this body hath a tailMore perilous than the head.ARVIRAGUSLet ordinanceCome as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,My brother hath done well.BELARIUSI had no mindTo hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sicknessDid make my way long forth.GUIDERIUSWith his own sword,Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'enHis head from him: I'll throw't into the creekBehind our rock; and let it to the sea,And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:That's all I reck.ExitBELARIUSI fear 'twill be revenged:Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valourBecomes thee well enough.ARVIRAGUSWould I had done'tSo the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,I love thee brotherly, but envy muchThou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,That possible strength might meet, would seek us throughAnd put us to our answer.BELARIUSWell, 'tis done:We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for dangerWhere there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stayTill hasty Polydote return, and bring himTo dinner presently.ARVIRAGUSPoor sick Fidele!I'll weringly to him: to gain his colourI'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,And praise myself for charity.ExitBELARIUSO thou goddess,Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'stIn these two princely boys! They are as gentleAs zephyrs blowing below the violet,Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,That by the top doth take the mountain pine,And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonderThat an invisible instinct should frame themTo royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,Civility not seen from other, valourThat wildly grows in them, but yields a cropAs if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strangeWhat Cloten's being here to us portends,Or what his death will bring us.Re-enter GUIDERIUSGUIDERIUSWhere's my brother?I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,In embassy to his mother: his body's hostageFor his return.Solemn musicBELARIUSMy ingenious instrument!Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasionHath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!GUIDERIUSIs he at home?BELARIUSHe went hence even now.GUIDERIUSWhat does he mean? since death of my dear'st motherit did not speak before. All solemn thingsShould answer solemn accidents. The matter?Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toysIs jollity for apes and grief for boys.Is Cadwal mad?BELARIUSLook, here he comes,And brings the dire occasion in his armsOf what we blame him for.Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his armsARVIRAGUSThe bird is deadThat we have made so much on. I had ratherHave skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,Than have seen this.GUIDERIUSO sweetest, fairest lily!My brother wears thee not the one half so wellAs when thou grew'st thyself.BELARIUSO melancholy!Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? findThe ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crareMight easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.How found you him?ARVIRAGUSStark, as you see:Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; hisright cheekReposing on a cushion.GUIDERIUSWhere?ARVIRAGUSO' the floor;His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and putMy clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudenessAnswer'd my steps too loud.GUIDERIUSWhy, he but sleeps:If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,And worms will not come to thee.ARVIRAGUSWith fairest flowersWhilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lackThe flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, norThe azured harebell, like thy veins, no, norThe leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shamingThose rich-left heirs that let their fathers lieWithout a monument!--bring thee all this;Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,To winter-ground thy corse.GUIDERIUSPrithee, have done;And do not play in wench-like words with thatWhich is so serious. Let us bury him,And not protract with admiration whatIs now due debt. To the grave!ARVIRAGUSSay, where shall's lay him?GUIDERIUSBy good Euriphile, our mother.ARVIRAGUSBe't so:And let us, Polydore, though now our voicesHave got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,As once our mother; use like note and words,Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.GUIDERIUSCadwal,I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;For notes of sorrow out of tune are worseThan priests and fanes that lie.ARVIRAGUSWe'll speak it, then.BELARIUSGreat griefs, I see, medicine the less; for ClotenIs quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;And though he came our enemy, rememberHe was paid for that: though mean andmighty, rottingTogether, have one dust, yet reverence,That angel of the world, doth make distinctionOf place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princelyAnd though you took his life, as being our foe,Yet bury him as a prince.GUIDERIUSPray You, fetch him hither.Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',When neither are alive.ARVIRAGUSIf you'll go fetch him,We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.Exit BELARIUSGUIDERIUSNay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;My father hath a reason for't.ARVIRAGUS'Tis true.GUIDERIUSCome on then, and remove him.ARVIRAGUSSo. Begin.SONGGUIDERIUSFear no more the heat o' the sun,Nor the furious winter's rages;Thou thy worldly task hast done,Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:Golden lads and girls all must,As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.ARVIRAGUSFear no more the frown o' the great;Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;Care no more to clothe and eat;To thee the reed is as the oak:The sceptre, learning, physic, mustAll follow this, and come to dust.GUIDERIUSFear no more the lightning flash,ARVIRAGUSNor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;GUIDERIUSFear not slander, censure rash;ARVIRAGUSThou hast finish'd joy and moan:GUIDERIUSARVIRAGUSAll lovers young, all lovers mustConsign to thee, and come to dust.GUIDERIUSNo exorciser harm thee!ARVIRAGUSNor no witchcraft charm thee!GUIDERIUSGhost unlaid forbear thee!ARVIRAGUSNothing ill come near thee!GUIDERIUSARVIRAGUSQuiet consummation have;And renowned be thy grave!Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTENGUIDERIUSWe have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.BELARIUSHere's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the nightAre strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.You were as flowers, now wither'd: even soThese herblets shall, which we upon you strew.Come on, away: apart upon our knees.The ground that gave them first has them again:Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUSIMOGEN[Awaking]  Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which isthe way?--I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.But, soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses!Seeing the body of CLOTENThese flowers are like the pleasures of the world;This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyesAre sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,I tremble stiff with fear: but if there beYet left in heaven as small a drop of pityAs a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!The dream's here still: even when I wake, it isWithout me, as within me; not imagined, felt.A headless man!

Pisanio,All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,Hast here cut off my lord. To write and readBe henceforth treacherous! Damn'd PisanioHath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--From this most bravest vessel of the worldStruck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!where's that?Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in themHave laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!The drug he gave me, which he said was preciousAnd cordial to me, have I not found itMurderous to the senses? That confirms it home:This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,That we the horrider may seem to thoseWhich chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!Falls on the bodyEnter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers, and a SoothsayerCaptainTo them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,After your will, have cross'd the sea, attendingYou here at Milford-Haven with your ships:They are in readiness.CAIUS LUCIUSBut what from Rome?CaptainThe senate hath stirr'd up the confinersAnd gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,That promise noble service: and they comeUnder the conduct of bold Iachimo,Syenna's brother.CAIUS LUCIUSWhen expect you them?CaptainWith the next benefit o' the wind.CAIUS LUCIUSThis forwardnessMakes our hopes fair.

Now, sir,What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?SoothsayerLast night the very gods show'd me a vision--I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'dFrom the spongy south to this part of the west,There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--Unless my sins abuse my divination--Success to the Roman host.CAIUS LUCIUSDream often so,And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is hereWithout his top? The ruin speaks that sometimeIt was a worthy building. How! a page!Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;For nature doth abhor to make his bedWith the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.Let's see the boy's face.CaptainHe's alive, my lord.CAIUS LUCIUSHe'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seemsThey crave to be demanded. Who is thisThou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was heThat, otherwise than noble nature did,Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interestIn this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?What art thou?IMOGENI am nothing: or if not,Nothing to be were better. This was my master,A very valiant Briton and a good,That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!There is no more such masters: I may wanderFrom east to occident, cry out for service,Try many, all good, serve truly, neverFind such another master.CAIUS LUCIUS'Lack, good youth!Thou movest no less with thy complaining thanThy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.IMOGENRichard du Champ.AsideIf I do lie and doNo harm by it, though the gods hear, I hopeThey'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?CAIUS LUCIUSThy name?IMOGENFidele, sir.CAIUS LUCIUSThou dost approve thyself the very same:Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not sayThou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,Sent by a consul to me, should not soonerThan thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.IMOGENI'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,I'll hide my master from the flies, as deepAs these poor pickaxes can dig; and whenWith wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,And on it said a century of prayers,Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;And leaving so his service, follow you,So please you entertain me.CAIUS LUCIUSAy, good youth!And rather father thee than master thee.My friends,The boy hath taught us manly duties: let usFind out the prettiest daisied plot we can,And make him with our pikes and partisansA grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'dBy thee to us, and he shall be interr'dAs soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyesSome falls are means the happier to arise.ExeuntSCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.Enter CYMBELINE, Lords, PISANIO, and AttendantsCYMBELINEAgain; and bring me word how 'tis with her.Exit an AttendantA fever with the absence of her son,A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,The great part of my comfort, gone; my queenUpon a desperate bed, and in a timeWhen fearful wars point at me; her son gone,So needful for this present: it strikes me, pastThe hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,Who needs must know of her departure andDost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from theeBy a sharp torture.PISANIOSir, my life is yours;I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,I nothing know where she remains, why gone,Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,Hold me your loyal servant.First LordGood my liege,The day that she was missing he was here:I dare be bound he's true and shall performAll parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,There wants no diligence in seeking him,And will, no doubt, be found.CYMBELINEThe time is troublesome.To PISANIOWe'll slip you for a season; but our jealousyDoes yet depend.First LordSo please your majesty,The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,Are landed on your coast, with a supplyOf Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.CYMBELINENow for the counsel of my son and queen!I am amazed with matter.First LordGood my liege,Your preparation can affront no lessThan what you hear of: come more, for moreyou're ready:The want is but to put those powers in motionThat long to move.CYMBELINEI thank you. Let's withdraw;And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear notWhat can from Italy annoy us; butWe grieve at chances here. Away!Exeunt all but PISANIOPISANIOI heard no letter from my master sinceI wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:Nor hear I from my mistress who did promiseTo yield me often tidings: neither know IWhat is betid to Cloten; but remainPerplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.These present wars shall find I love my country,Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.ExitSCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.GUIDERIUSThe noise is round about us.BELARIUSLet us from it.ARVIRAGUSWhat pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock itFrom action and adventure?GUIDERIUSNay, what hopeHave we in hiding us? This way, the RomansMust or for Britons slay us, or receive usFor barbarous and unnatural revoltsDuring their use, and slay us after.BELARIUSSons,We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.To the king's party there's no going: newnessOf Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'dAmong the bands--may drive us to a renderWhere we have lived, and so extort from's thatWhich we have done, whose answer would be deathDrawn on with torture.GUIDERIUSThis is, sir, a doubtIn such a time nothing becoming you,Nor satisfying us.ARVIRAGUSIt is not likelyThat when they hear the Roman horses neigh,Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyesAnd ears so cloy'd importantly as now,That they will waste their time upon our note,To know from whence we are.BELARIUSO, I am knownOf many in the army: many years,Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore himFrom my remembrance. And, besides, the kingHath not deserved my service nor your loves;Who find in my exile the want of breeding,The certainty of this hard life; aye hopelessTo have the courtesy your cradle promised,But to be still hot summer's tamings andThe shrinking slaves of winter.GUIDERIUSThan be soBetter to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:I and my brother are not known; yourselfSo out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,Cannot be question'd.ARVIRAGUSBy this sun that shines,I'll thither: what thing is it that I neverDid see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!Never bestrid a horse, save one that hadA rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowelNor iron on his heel! I am ashamedTo look upon the holy sun, to haveThe benefit of his blest beams, remainingSo long a poor unknown.GUIDERIUSBy heavens, I'll go:If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,I'll take the better care, but if you will not,The hazard therefore due fall on me byThe hands of Romans!ARVIRAGUSSo say I	amen.BELARIUSNo reason I, since of your lives you setSo slight a valuation, should reserveMy crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!If in your country wars you chance to die,That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:Lead, lead.AsideThe time seems long; their bloodthinks scorn,Till it fly out and show them princes born.ExeuntACT VSCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchiefPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSYea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'dThou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,If each of you should take this course, how manyMust murder wives much better than themselvesFor wrying but a little! O Pisanio!Every good servant does not all commands:No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if youShould have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I neverHad lived to put on this: so had you savedThe noble Imogen to repent, and struckMe, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,To have them fall no more: you some permitTo second ills with ills, each elder worse,And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,And make me blest to obey! I am brought hitherAmong the Italian gentry, and to fightAgainst my lady's kingdom: 'tis enoughThat, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe meOf these Italian weeds and suit myselfAs does a Briton peasant: so I'll fightAgainst the part I come with; so I'll dieFor thee, O Imogen, even for whom my lifeIs every breath a death; and thus, unknown,Pitied nor hated, to the face of perilMyself I'll dedicate. Let me make men knowMore valour in me than my habits show.Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!To shame the guise o' the world, I will beginThe fashion, less without and more within.ExitSCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and  the Roman Army: from the other side, the  British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following,  like a poor soldier. They march over and go  out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves himIACHIMOThe heaviness and guilt within my bosomTakes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,The princess of this country, and the air on'tRevengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,A very drudge of nature's, have subdued meIn my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borneAs I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.If that thy gentry, Britain, go beforeThis lout as he exceeds our lords, the oddsIs that we scarce are men and you are gods.ExitThe battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is  taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUSBELARIUSStand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;The lane is guarded: nothing routs us butThe villany of our fears.GUIDERIUSARVIRAGUSStand, stand, and fight!Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the  Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGENCAIUS LUCIUSAway, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;For friends kill friends, and the disorder's suchAs war were hoodwink'd.IACHIMO'Tis their fresh supplies.CAIUS LUCIUSIt is a day turn'd strangely: or betimesLet's reinforce, or fly.ExeuntSCENE III. Another part of the field.Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British LordLordCamest thou from where they made the stand?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI did.Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.LordI did.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSNo blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,But that the heavens fought: the king himselfOf his wings destitute, the army broken,And but the backs of Britons seen, all flyingThrough a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having workMore plentiful than tools to do't, struck downSome mortally, some slightly touch'd, some fallingMerely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'dWith dead men hurt behind, and cowards livingTo die with lengthen'd shame.LordWhere was this lane?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSClose by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,An honest one, I warrant; who deservedSo long a breeding as his white beard came to,In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,He, with two striplings-lads more like to runThe country base than to commit such slaughterWith faces fit for masks, or rather fairerThan those for preservation cased, or shame--Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;Or we are Romans and will give you thatLike beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'These three,Three thousand confident, in act as many--For three performers are the file when allThe rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'Accommodated by the place, more charmingWith their own nobleness, which could have turn'dA distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,turn'd cowardBut by example--O, a sin in war,Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to lookThe way that they did, and to grin like lionsUpon the pikes o' the hunters. Then beganA stop i' the chaser, a retire, anonA rout, confusion thick; forthwith they flyChickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,Like fragments in hard voyages, becameThe life o' the need: having found the backdoor openOf the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!Some slain before; some dying; some their friendsO'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:Those that would die or ere resist are grownThe mortal bugs o' the field.LordThis was strange chanceA narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSNay, do not wonder at it: you are madeRather to wonder at the things you hearThan to work any.

Here is one:'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'LordNay, be not angry, sir.POSTHUMUS LEONATUS'Lack, to what end?Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;For if he'll do as he is made to do,I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.You have put me into rhyme.LordFarewell; you're angry.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSStill going?Exit LordThis is a lord! O noble misery,To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!To-day how many would have given their honoursTo have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,Could not find death where I did hear him groan,Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,Sweet words; or hath more ministers than weThat draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find himFor being now a favourer to the Briton,No more a Briton, I have resumed againThe part I came in: fight I will no more,But yield me to the veriest hind that shallOnce touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter isHere made by the Roman; great the answer beBritons must take. For me, my ransom's death;On either side I come to spend my breath;Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,But end it by some means for Imogen.Enter two British Captains and SoldiersFirst CaptainGreat Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.Second CaptainThere was a fourth man, in a silly habit,That gave the affront with them.First CaptainSo 'tis reported:But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSA Roman,Who had not now been drooping here, if secondsHad answer'd him.Second CaptainLay hands on him; a dog!A leg of Rome shall not return to tellWhat crows have peck'd them here. He bragshis serviceAs if he were of note: bring him to the king.Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,  PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.

My conscience, thou art fetter'dMore than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give meThe penitent instrument to pick that bolt,Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?So children temporal fathers do appease;Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?I cannot do it better than in gyves,Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,If of my freedom 'tis the main part, takeNo stricter render of me than my all.I know you are more clement than vile men,Who of their broken debtors take a third,A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive againOn their abatement: that's not my desire:For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,If you will take this audit, take this life,And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!I'll speak to thee in silence.SleepsSolemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,  SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,  an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in  his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother  to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:  then, after other music, follow the two young  Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with  wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleepingSicilius LeonatusNo more, thou thunder-master, showThy spite on mortal flies:With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,That thy adulteriesRates and revenges.Hath my poor boy done aught but well,Whose face I never saw?I died whilst in the womb he stay'dAttending nature's law:Whose father then, as men reportThou orphans' father art,Thou shouldst have been, and shielded himFrom this earth-vexing smart.MotherLucina lent not me her aid,But took me in my throes;That from me was Posthumus ript,Came crying 'mongst his foes,A thing of pity!Sicilius LeonatusGreat nature, like his ancestry,Moulded the stuff so fair,That he deserved the praise o' the world,As great Sicilius' heir.First BrotherWhen once he was mature for man,In Britain where was heThat could stand up his parallel;Or fruitful object beIn eye of Imogen, that bestCould deem his dignity?MotherWith marriage wherefore was he mock'd,To be exiled, and thrownFrom Leonati seat, and castFrom her his dearest one,Sweet Imogen?Sicilius LeonatusWhy did you suffer Iachimo,Slight thing of Italy,To taint his nobler heart and brainWith needless jealosy;And to become the geck and scornO' th' other's villany?Second BrotherFor this from stiller seats we came,Our parents and us twain,That striking in our country's causeFell bravely and were slain,Our fealty and Tenantius' rightWith honour to maintain.First BrotherLike hardiment Posthumus hathTo Cymbeline perform'd:Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,Why hast thou thus adjourn'dThe graces for his merits due,Being all to dolours turn'd?Sicilius LeonatusThy crystal window ope; look out;No longer exerciseUpon a valiant race thy harshAnd potent injuries.MotherSince, Jupiter, our son is good,Take off his miseries.Sicilius LeonatusPeep through thy marble mansion; help;Or we poor ghosts will cryTo the shining synod of the restAgainst thy deity.First BrotherSecond BrotherHelp, Jupiter; or we appeal,And from thy justice fly.Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting  upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Apparitions fall on their kneesJupiterNo more, you petty spirits of region low,Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghostsAccuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and restUpon your never-withering banks of flowers:Be not with mortal accidents opprest;No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and inOur temple was he married. Rise, and fade.He shall be lord of lady Imogen,And happier much by his affliction made.This tablet lay upon his breast, whereinOur pleasure his full fortune doth confine:and so, away: no further with your dinExpress impatience, lest you stir up mine.Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.AscendsSicilius LeonatusHe came in thunder; his celestial breathWas sulphurous to smell: the holy eagleStoop'd as to foot us: his ascension isMore sweet than our blest fields: his royal birdPrunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,As when his god is pleased.AllThanks, Jupiter!Sicilius LeonatusThe marble pavement closes, he is enter'dHis radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,Let us with care perform his great behest.The Apparitions vanishPosthumus Leonatus[Waking]  Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begotA father to me; and thou hast createdA mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:And so I am awake. Poor wretches that dependOn greatness' favour dream as I have done,Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:Many dream not to find, neither deserve,And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,That have this golden chance and know not why.What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!Be not, as is our fangled world, a garmentNobler than that it covers: let thy effectsSo follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,As good as promise.Reads'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece oftender air; and when from a stately cedar shall belopped branches, which, being dead many years,shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock andfreshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.''Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmenTongue and brain not; either both or nothing;Or senseless speaking or a speaking suchAs sense cannot untie. Be what it is,The action of my life is like it, whichI'll keep, if but for sympathy.Re-enter First GaolerFirst GaolerCome, sir, are you ready for death?POSTHUMUS LEONATUSOver-roasted rather; ready long ago.First GaolerHanging is the word, sir: ifyou be ready for that, you are well cooked.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSSo, if I prove a good repast to thespectators, the dish pays the shot.First GaolerA heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,you shall be called to no more payments, fear nomore tavern-bills; which are often the sadness ofparting, as the procuring of mirth: you come inflint for want of meat, depart reeling with toomuch drink; sorry that you have paid too much, andsorry that you are paid too much; purse and brainboth empty; the brain the heavier for being toolight, the purse too light, being drawn ofheaviness: of this contradiction you shall now bequit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums upthousands in a trice: you have no true debitor andcreditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book andcounters; so the acquittance follows.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI am merrier to die than thou art to live.First GaolerIndeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not thetooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep yoursleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think hewould change places with his officer; for, look you,sir, you know not which way you shall go.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYes, indeed do I, fellow.First GaolerYour death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seenhim so pictured: you must either be directed bysome that take upon them to know, or do take uponyourself that which I am sure you do not know, orjump the after inquiry on your own peril: and howyou shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'llnever return to tell one.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes todirect them the way I am going, but such as wink andwill not use them.First GaolerWhat an infinite mock is this, that a man shouldhave the best use of eyes to see the way ofblindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.Enter a MessengerMessengerKnock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.First GaolerI'll be hang'd then.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSThou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and MessengerFirst GaolerUnless a man would marry a gallows and beget younggibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on myconscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,for all he be a Roman: and there be some of themtoo that die against their wills; so should I, if Iwere one. I would we were all of one mind, and onemind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers andgallowses! I speak against my present profit, butmy wish hath a preferment in 't.ExeuntSCENE V.

Woe is my heartThat the poor soldier that so richly fought,Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breastStepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:He shall be happy that can find him, ifOur grace can make him so.BELARIUSI never sawSuch noble fury in so poor a thing;Such precious deeds in one that promises noughtBut beggary and poor looks.CYMBELINENo tidings of him?PISANIOHe hath been search'd among the dead and living,But no trace of him.CYMBELINETo my grief, I amThe heir of his reward;To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUSwhich I will addTo you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the timeTo ask of whence you are. Report it.BELARIUSSir,In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:Further to boast were neither true nor modest,Unless I add, we are honest.CYMBELINEBow your knees.Arise my knights o' the battle: I create youCompanions to our person and will fit youWith dignities becoming your estates.Enter CORNELIUS and LadiesThere's business in these faces. Why so sadlyGreet you our victory? you look like Romans,And not o' the court of Britain.CORNELIUSHail, great king!To sour your happiness, I must reportThe queen is dead.CYMBELINEWho worse than a physicianWould this report become? But I consider,By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet deathWill seize the doctor too. How ended she?CORNELIUSWith horror, madly dying, like her life,Which, being cruel to the world, concludedMost cruel to herself. What she confess'dI will report, so please you: these her womenCan trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeksWere present when she finish'd.CYMBELINEPrithee, say.CORNELIUSFirst, she confess'd she never loved you, onlyAffected greatness got by you, not you:Married your royalty, was wife to your place;Abhorr'd your person.CYMBELINEShe alone knew this;And, but she spoke it dying, I would notBelieve her lips in opening it. Proceed.CORNELIUSYour daughter, whom she bore in hand to loveWith such integrity, she did confessWas as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,But that her flight prevented it, she hadTa'en off by poison.CYMBELINEO most delicate fiend!Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?CORNELIUSMore, sir, and worse. She did confess she hadFor you a mortal mineral; which, being took,Should by the minute feed on life and lingeringBy inches waste you: in which time she purposed,By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, toO'ercome you with her show, and in time,When she had fitted you with her craft, to workHer son into the adoption of the crown:But, failing of her end by his strange absence,Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despiteOf heaven and men, her purposes; repentedThe evils she hatch'd were not effected; soDespairing died.CYMBELINEHeard you all this, her women?First LadyWe did, so please your highness.CYMBELINEMine eyesWere not in fault, for she was beautiful;Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,That thought her like her seeming; it hadbeen viciousTo have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other  Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGENThou comest not, Caius, now for tribute thatThe Britons have razed out, though with the lossOf many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suitThat their good souls may be appeased with slaughterOf you their captives, which ourself have granted:So think of your estate.CAIUS LUCIUSConsider, sir, the chance of war: the dayWas yours by accident; had it gone with us,We should not, when the blood was cool,have threaten'dOur prisoners with the sword. But since the godsWill have it thus, that nothing but our livesMay be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficethA Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:Augustus lives to think on't: and so muchFor my peculiar care. This one thing onlyI will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,Let him be ransom'd: never master hadA page so kind, so duteous, diligent,So tender over his occasions, true,So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue joinWith my request, which I make bold your highnessCannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,And spare no blood beside.CYMBELINEI have surely seen him:His favour is familiar to me. Boy,Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,The noblest ta'en.IMOGENI humbly thank your highness.CAIUS LUCIUSI do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;And yet I know thou wilt.IMOGENNo, no: alack,There's other work in hand: I see a thingBitter to me as death: your life, good master,Must shuffle for itself.CAIUS LUCIUSThe boy disdains me,He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joysThat place them on the truth of girls and boys.Why stands he so perplex'd?CYMBELINEWhat wouldst thou, boy?I love thee more and more: think more and moreWhat's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?IMOGENHe is a Roman; no more kin to meThan I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,Am something nearer.CYMBELINEWherefore eyest him so?IMOGENI'll tell you, sir, in private, if you pleaseTo give me hearing.CYMBELINEAy, with all my heart,And lend my best attention. What's thy name?IMOGENFidele, sir.CYMBELINEThou'rt my good youth, my page;I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apartBELARIUSIs not this boy revived from death?ARVIRAGUSOne sand anotherNot more resembles that sweet rosy ladWho died, and was Fidele. What think you?GUIDERIUSThe same dead thing alive.BELARIUSPeace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sureHe would have spoke to us.GUIDERIUSBut we saw him dead.BELARIUSBe silent; let's see further.PISANIO[Aside]	It is my mistress:Since she is living, let the time run onTo good or bad.CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forwardCYMBELINECome, stand thou by our side;Make thy demand aloud.To IACHIMOSir, step you forth;Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,Which is our honour, bitter torture shallWinnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.IMOGENMy boon is, that this gentleman may renderOf whom he had this ring.POSTHUMUS LEONATUS[Aside]                 What's that to him?CYMBELINEThat diamond upon your finger, sayHow came it yours?IACHIMOThou'lt torture me to leave unspoken thatWhich, to be spoke, would torture thee.CYMBELINEHow! me?IACHIMOI am glad to be constrain'd to utter thatWhich torments me to conceal. By villanyI got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;Whom thou didst banish; and--which more maygrieve thee,As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?CYMBELINEAll that belongs to this.IACHIMOThat paragon, thy daughter,--For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spiritsQuail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.CYMBELINEMy daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:I had rather thou shouldst live while nature willThan die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.IACHIMOUpon a time,--unhappy was the clockThat struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursedThe mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, wouldOur viands had been poison'd, or at leastThose which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--What should I say? he was too good to beWhere ill men were; and was the best of allAmongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,Hearing us praise our loves of ItalyFor beauty that made barren the swell'd boastOf him that best could speak, for feature, lamingThe shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,A shop of all the qualities that manLoves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,Fairness which strikes the eye--CYMBELINEI stand on fire:Come to the matter.IACHIMOAll too soon I shall,Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,Most like a noble lord in love and oneThat had a royal lover, took his hint;And, not dispraising whom we praised,--thereinHe was as calm as virtue--he beganHis mistress' picture; which by his tonguebeing made,And then a mind put in't, either our bragsWere crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his descriptionProved us unspeaking sots.CYMBELINENay, nay, to the purpose.IACHIMOYour daughter's chastity--there it begins.He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with himPieces of gold 'gainst this which then he woreUpon his honour'd finger, to attainIn suit the place of's bed and win this ringBy hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,No lesser of her honour confidentThan I did truly find her, stakes this ring;And would so, had it been a carbuncleOf Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had itBeen all the worth of's car. Away to BritainPost I in this design: well may you, sir,Remember me at court; where I was taughtOf your chaste daughter the wide difference'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'dOf hope, not longing, mine Italian brain'Gan in your duller Britain operateMost vilely; for my vantage, excellent:And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,That I return'd with simular proof enoughTo make the noble Leonatus mad,By wounding his belief in her renownWith tokens thus, and thus; averting notesOf chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marksOf secret on her person, that he could notBut think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--Methinks, I see him now--POSTHUMUS LEONATUS[Advancing]             Ay, so thou dost,Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,Egregious murderer, thief, any thingThat's due to all the villains past, in being,To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send outFor torturers ingenious: it is IThat all the abhorred things o' the earth amendBy being worse than they. I am Posthumus,That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--That caused a lesser villain than myself,A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the templeOf virtue was she; yea, and she herself.Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, setThe dogs o' the street to bay me: every villainBe call'd Posthumus Leonitus; andBe villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,Imogen, Imogen!IMOGENPeace, my lord; hear, hear--POSTHUMUS LEONATUSShall's have a play of this?

Have you ta'en of it?IMOGENMost like I did, for I was dead.BELARIUSMy boys,There was our error.GUIDERIUSThis is, sure, Fidele.IMOGENWhy did you throw your wedded lady from you?Think that you are upon a rock; and nowThrow me again.Embracing himPOSTHUMUS LEONATUSHang there like a fruit, my soul,Till the tree die!CYMBELINEHow now, my flesh, my child!What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?Wilt thou not speak to me?IMOGEN[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir.BELARIUS[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did lovethis youth, I blame ye not:You had a motive for't.CYMBELINEMy tears that fallProve holy water on thee! Imogen,Thy mother's dead.IMOGENI am sorry for't, my lord.CYMBELINEO, she was nought; and long of her it wasThat we meet here so strangely: but her sonIs gone, we know not how nor where.PISANIOMy lord,Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,Upon my lady's missing, came to meWith his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,If I discover'd not which way she was gone,It was my instant death. By accident,had a feigned letter of my master'sThen in my pocket; which directed himTo seek her on the mountains near to Milford;Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,Which he enforced from me, away he postsWith unchaste purpose and with oath to violateMy lady's honour: what became of himI further know not.GUIDERIUSLet me end the story:I slew him there.CYMBELINEMarry, the gods forfend!I would not thy good deeds should from my lipsPluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,Deny't again.GUIDERIUSI have spoke it, and I did it.CYMBELINEHe was a prince.GUIDERIUSA most incivil one: the wrongs he did meWere nothing prince-like; for he did provoke meWith language that would make me spurn the sea,If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;And am right glad he is not standing hereTo tell this tale of mine.CYMBELINEI am sorry for thee:By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and mustEndure our law: thou'rt dead.IMOGENThat headless manI thought had been my lord.CYMBELINEBind the offender,And take him from our presence.BELARIUSStay, sir king:This man is better than the man he slew,As well descended as thyself; and hathMore of thee merited than a band of ClotensHad ever scar for.To the GuardLet his arms alone;They were not born for bondage.CYMBELINEWhy, old soldier,Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,By tasting of our wrath? How of descentAs good as we?ARVIRAGUSIn that he spake too far.CYMBELINEAnd thou shalt die for't.BELARIUSWe will die all three:But I will prove that two on's are as goodAs I have given out him. My sons, I must,For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,Though, haply, well for you.ARVIRAGUSYour danger's ours.GUIDERIUSAnd our good his.BELARIUSHave at it then, by leave.Thou hadst, great king, a subject whoWas call'd Belarius.CYMBELINEWhat of him? he isA banish'd traitor.BELARIUSHe it is that hathAssumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;I know not how a traitor.CYMBELINETake him hence:The whole world shall not save him.BELARIUSNot too hot:First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;And let it be confiscate all, so soonAs I have received it.CYMBELINENursing of my sons!BELARIUSI am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,These two young gentlemen, that call me fatherAnd think they are my sons, are none of mine;They are the issue of your loins, my liege,And blood of your begetting.CYMBELINEHow! my issue!BELARIUSSo sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishmentItself, and all my treason; that I suffer'dWas all the harm I did. These gentle princes--For such and so they are--these twenty yearsHave I train'd up: those arts they have as ICould put into them; my breeding was, sir, asYour highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these childrenUpon my banishment: I moved her to't,Having received the punishment before,For that which I did then: beaten for loyaltyExcited me to treason: their dear loss,The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shapedUnto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,Here are your sons again; and I must loseTwo of the sweet'st companions in the world.The benediction of these covering heavensFall on their heads like dew! for they are worthyTo inlay heaven with stars.CYMBELINEThou weep'st, and speak'st.The service that you three have done is moreUnlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:If these be they, I know not how to wishA pair of worthier sons.BELARIUSBe pleased awhile.This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'dIn a most curious mantle, wrought by the handOf his queen mother, which for more probationI can with ease produce.CYMBELINEGuiderius hadUpon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;It was a mark of wonder.BELARIUSThis is he;Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:It was wise nature's end in the donation,To be his evidence now.CYMBELINEO, what, am IA mother to the birth of three? Ne'er motherRejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,That, after this strange starting from your orbs,may reign in them now! O Imogen,Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.IMOGENNo, my lord;I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,Have we thus met? O, never say hereafterBut I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,When I was but your sister; I you brothers,When ye were so indeed.CYMBELINEDid you e'er meet?ARVIRAGUSAy, my good lord.GUIDERIUSAnd at first meeting loved;Continued so, until we thought he died.CORNELIUSBy the queen's dram she swallow'd.CYMBELINEO rare instinct!When shall I hear all through? This fierceabridgementHath to it circumstantial branches, whichDistinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?And when came you to serve our Roman captive?How parted with your brothers? how first met them?Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,And your three motives to the battle, withI know not how much more, should be demanded;And all the other by-dependencies,From chance to chance: but nor the time nor placeWill serve our long inter'gatories. See,Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eyeOn him, her brother, me, her master, hittingEach object with a joy: the counterchangeIs severally in all. Let's quit this ground,And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.To BELARIUSThou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.IMOGENYou are my father too, and did relieve me,To see this gracious season.CYMBELINEAll o'erjoy'd,Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,For they shall taste our comfort.IMOGENMy good master,I will yet do you service.CAIUS LUCIUSHappy be you!CYMBELINEThe forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,He would have well becomed this place, and gracedThe thankings of a king.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSI am, sir,The soldier that did company these threeIn poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment forThe purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and mightHave made you finish.IACHIMO[Kneeling]          I am down again:But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,Which I so often owe: but your ring first;And here the bracelet of the truest princessThat ever swore her faith.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSKneel not to me:The power that I have on you is, to spare you;The malice towards you to forgive you: live,And deal with others better.CYMBELINENobly doom'd!We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;Pardon's the word to all.ARVIRAGUSYou holp us, sir,As you did mean indeed to be our brother;Joy'd are we that you are.POSTHUMUS LEONATUSYour servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methoughtGreat Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,Appear'd to me, with other spritely showsOf mine own kindred: when I waked, I foundThis label on my bosom; whose containingIs so from sense in hardness, that I canMake no collection of it: let him showHis skill in the construction.CAIUS LUCIUSPhilarmonus!SoothsayerHere, my good lord.CAIUS LUCIUSRead, and declare the meaning.Soothsayer[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himselfunknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by apiece of tender air; and when from a stately cedarshall be lopped branches, which, being dead manyyears, shall after revive, be jointed to the oldstock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus endhis miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish inpeace and plenty.'Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;The fit and apt construction of thy name,Being Leonatus, doth import so much.To CYMBELINEThe piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divineIs this most constant wife; who, even now,Answering the letter of the oracle,Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd aboutWith this most tender air.CYMBELINEThis hath some seeming.SoothsayerThe lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches pointThy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,For many years thought dead, are now revived,To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issuePromises Britain peace and plenty.CYMBELINEWellMy peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,And to the Roman empire; promisingTo pay our wonted tribute, from the whichWe were dissuaded by our wicked queen;Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,Have laid most heavy hand.SoothsayerThe fingers of the powers above do tuneThe harmony of this peace. The visionWhich I made known to Lucius, ere the strokeOf this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instantIs full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,From south to west on wing soaring aloft,Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sunSo vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,The imperial Caesar, should again uniteHis favour with the radiant Cymbeline,Which shines here in the west.CYMBELINELaud we the gods;And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrilsFrom our blest altars. Publish we this peaceTo all our subjects. Set we forward: letA Roman and a British ensign waveFriendly together: so through Lud's-town march:And in the temple of great JupiterOur peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.Set on there! Never was a war did cease,Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.Exeunt
