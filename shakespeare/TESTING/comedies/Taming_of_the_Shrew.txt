Enter a Lord from hunting, with his trainLordHuntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it goodAt the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.First HuntsmanWhy, Belman is as good as he, my lord;He cried upon it at the merest lossAnd twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:Trust me, I take him for the better dog.LordThou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,I would esteem him worth a dozen such.But sup them well and look unto them all:To-morrow I intend to hunt again.First HuntsmanI will, my lord.LordWhat's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?Second HuntsmanHe breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.LordO monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,A most delicious banquet by his bed,And brave attendants near him when he wakes,Would not the beggar then forget himself?First HuntsmanBelieve me, lord, I think he cannot choose.Second HuntsmanIt would seem strange unto him when he waked.LordEven as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.Then take him up and manage well the jest:Carry him gently to my fairest chamberAnd hang it round with all my wanton pictures:Balm his foul head in warm distilled watersAnd burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:Procure me music ready when he wakes,To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;And if he chance to speak, be ready straightAnd with a low submissive reverenceSay 'What is it your honour will command?'Let one attend him with a silver basinFull of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'Some one be ready with a costly suitAnd ask him what apparel he will wear;Another tell him of his hounds and horse,And that his lady mourns at his disease:Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;And when he says he is, say that he dreams,For he is nothing but a mighty lord.This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:It will be pastime passing excellent,If it be husbanded with modesty.First HuntsmanMy lord, I warrant you we will play our part,As he shall think by our true diligenceHe is no less than what we say he is.LordTake him up gently and to bed with him;And each one to his office when he wakes.Some bear out SLY. A trumpet soundsSirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:Exit ServingmanBelike, some noble gentleman that means,Travelling some journey, to repose him here.Re-enter ServingmanHow now! who is it?ServantAn't please your honour, playersThat offer service to your lordship.LordBid them come near.Enter PlayersNow, fellows, you are welcome.PlayersWe thank your honour.LordDo you intend to stay with me tonight?A PlayerSo please your lordship to accept our duty.LordWith all my heart. This fellow I remember,Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:I have forgot your name; but, sure, that partWas aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.A PlayerI think 'twas Soto that your honour means.Lord'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.Well, you are come to me in a happy time;The rather for I have some sport in handWherein your cunning can assist me much.There is a lord will hear you play to-night:But I am doubtful of your modesties;Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--For yet his honour never heard a play--You break into some merry passionAnd so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,If you should smile he grows impatient.A PlayerFear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,Were he the veriest antic in the world.LordGo, sirrah, take them to the buttery,And give them friendly welcome every one:Let them want nothing that my house affords.Exit one with the PlayersSirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.Tell him from me, as he will win my love,He bear himself with honourable action,Such as he hath observed in noble ladiesUnto their lords, by them accomplished:Such duty to the drunkard let him doWith soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,And say 'What is't your honour will command,Wherein your lady and your humble wifeMay show her duty and make known her love?'And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,And with declining head into his bosom,Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'dTo see her noble lord restored to health,Who for this seven years hath esteem'd himNo better than a poor and loathsome beggar:And if the boy have not a woman's giftTo rain a shower of commanded tears,An onion will do well for such a shift,Which in a napkin being close convey'dShall in despite enforce a watery eye.See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:Anon I'll give thee more instructions.Exit a ServingmanI know the boy will well usurp the grace,Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,And how my men will stay themselves from laughterWhen they do homage to this simple peasant.I'll in to counsel them; haply my presenceMay well abate the over-merry spleenWhich otherwise would grow into extremes.ExeuntSCENE II.

Am not I ChristopherSly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth apedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation abear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, ifshe know me not: if she say I am not fourteen penceon the score for sheer ale, score me up for thelyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am notbestraught: here's--Third ServantO, this it is that makes your lady mourn!Second ServantO, this is it that makes your servants droop!LordHence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishmentAnd banish hence these abject lowly dreams.Look how thy servants do attend on thee,Each in his office ready at thy beck.Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,MusicAnd twenty caged nightingales do sing:Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couchSofter and sweeter than the lustful bedOn purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soarAbove the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer themAnd fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.First ServantSay thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swiftAs breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.Second ServantDost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straightAdonis painted by a running brook,And Cytherea all in sedges hid,Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,Even as the waving sedges play with wind.LordWe'll show thee Io as she was a maid,And how she was beguiled and surprised,As lively painted as the deed was done.Third ServantOr Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.LordThou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:Thou hast a lady far more beautifulThan any woman in this waning age.First ServantAnd till the tears that she hath shed for theeLike envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,She was the fairest creature in the world;And yet she is inferior to none.SLYAm I a lord? and have I such a lady?Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:Upon my life, I am a lord indeedAnd not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.Second ServantWill't please your mightiness to wash your hands?O, how we joy to see your wit restored!O, that once more you knew but what you are!These fifteen years you have been in a dream;Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.SLYThese fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.But did I never speak of all that time?First ServantO, yes, my lord, but very idle words:For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;And rail upon the hostess of the house;And say you would present her at the leet,Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.SLYAy, the woman's maid of the house.Third ServantWhy, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of GreeceAnd Peter Turph and Henry PimpernellAnd twenty more such names and men as theseWhich never were nor no man ever saw.SLYNow Lord be thanked for my good amends!ALLAmen.SLYI thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.Enter the Page as a lady, with attendantsPageHow fares my noble lord?SLYMarry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.Where is my wife?PageHere, noble lord: what is thy will with her?SLYAre you my wife and will not call me husband?My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.PageMy husband and my lord, my lord and husband;I am your wife in all obedience.SLYI know it well. What must I call her?LordMadam.SLYAl'ce madam, or Joan madam?Lord'Madam,' and nothing else: so lordscall ladies.SLYMadam wife, they say that I have dream'dAnd slept above some fifteen year or more.PageAy, and the time seems thirty unto me,Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.SLY'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.Madam, undress you and come now to bed.PageThrice noble lord, let me entreat of youTo pardon me yet for a night or two,Or, if not so, until the sun be set:For your physicians have expressly charged,In peril to incur your former malady,That I should yet absent me from your bed:I hope this reason stands for my excuse.SLYAy, it stands so that I may hardlytarry so long. But I would be loath to fall intomy dreams again: I will therefore tarry indespite of the flesh and the blood.Enter a MessengerMessengerYour honour's players, heating your amendment,Are come to play a pleasant comedy;For so your doctors hold it very meet,Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:Therefore they thought it good you hear a playAnd frame your mind to mirth and merriment,Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.SLYMarry, I will, let them play it. Is not acomondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?PageNo, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.SLYWhat, household stuff?PageIt is a kind of history.SLYWell, well see't.

LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand byBAPTISTAGentlemen, importune me no farther,For how I firmly am resolved you know;That is, not bestow my youngest daughterBefore I have a husband for the elder:If either of you both love Katharina,Because I know you well and love you well,Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.GREMIO[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?KATHARINAI pray you, sir, is it your willTo make a stale of me amongst these mates?HORTENSIOMates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.KATHARINAI'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:I wis it is not half way to her heart;But if it were, doubt not her care should beTo comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stoolAnd paint your face and use you like a fool.HORTENSIAFrom all such devils, good Lord deliver us!GREMIOAnd me too, good Lord!TRANIOHush, master! here's some good pastime toward:That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.LUCENTIOBut in the other's silence do I seeMaid's mild behavior and sobriety.Peace, Tranio!TRANIOWell said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.BAPTISTAGentlemen, that I may soon make goodWhat I have said, Bianca, get you in:And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.KATHARINAA pretty peat! it is bestPut finger in the eye, an she knew why.BIANCASister, content you in my discontent.Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:My books and instruments shall be my company,On them to took and practise by myself.LUCENTIOHark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.HORTENSIOSignior Baptista, will you be so strange?Sorry am I that our good will effectsBianca's grief.GREMIOWhy will you mew her up,Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,And make her bear the penance of her tongue?BAPTISTAGentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:Go in, Bianca:Exit BIANCAAnd for I know she taketh most delightIn music, instruments and poetry,Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,Prefer them hither; for to cunning menI will be very kind, and liberalTo mine own children in good bringing up:And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;For I have more to commune with Bianca.ExitKATHARINAWhy, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, Iknew not what to take and what to leave, ha?ExitGREMIOYou may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are sogood, here's none will hold you. Their love is notso great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nailstogether, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough onboth sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear mysweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fitman to teach her that wherein she delights, I willwish him to her father.HORTENSIOSo will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brookedparle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,that we may yet again have access to our fairmistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, tolabour and effect one thing specially.GREMIOWhat's that, I pray?HORTENSIOMarry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.GREMIOA husband! a devil.HORTENSIOI say, a husband.GREMIOI say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, thoughher father be very rich, any man is so very a foolto be married to hell?HORTENSIOTush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mineto endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be goodfellows in the world, an a man could light on them,would take her with all faults, and money enough.GREMIOI cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry withthis condition, to be whipped at the high crossevery morning.HORTENSIOFaith, as you say, there's small choice in rottenapples. But come; since this bar in law makes usfriends, it shall be so far forth friendlymaintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughterto a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy manbe his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.How say you, Signior Gremio?GREMIOI am agreed; and would I had given him the besthorse in Padua to begin his wooing that wouldthoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid thehouse of her! Come on.Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIOTRANIOI pray, sir, tell me, is it possibleThat love should of a sudden take such hold?LUCENTIOO Tranio, till I found it to be true,I never thought it possible or likely;But see, while idly I stood looking on,I found the effect of love in idleness:And now in plainness do confess to thee,That art to me as secret and as dearAs Anna to the queen of Carthage was,Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,If I achieve not this young modest girl.Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.TRANIOMaster, it is no time to chide you now;Affection is not rated from the heart:If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'LUCENTIOGramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.TRANIOMaster, you look'd so longly on the maid,Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.LUCENTIOO yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,Such as the daughter of Agenor had,That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.TRANIOSaw you no more? mark'd you not how her sisterBegan to scold and raise up such a stormThat mortal ears might hardly endure the din?LUCENTIOTranio, I saw her coral lips to moveAnd with her breath she did perfume the air:Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.TRANIONay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewdThat till the father rid his hands of her,Master, your love must live a maid at home;And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.LUCENTIOAh, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!But art thou not advised, he took some careTo get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?TRANIOAy, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.LUCENTIOI have it, Tranio.TRANIOMaster, for my hand,Both our inventions meet and jump in one.LUCENTIOTell me thine first.TRANIOYou will be schoolmasterAnd undertake the teaching of the maid:That's your device.LUCENTIOIt is: may it be done?TRANIONot possible; for who shall bear your part,And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,Visit his countrymen and banquet them?LUCENTIOBasta; content thee, for I have it full.We have not yet been seen in any house,Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our facesFor man or master; then it follows thus;Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,Keep house and port and servants as I should:I will some other be, some Florentine,Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at onceUncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.TRANIOSo had you need.In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,And I am tied to be obedient;For so your father charged me at our parting,'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,Although I think 'twas in another sense;I am content to be Lucentio,Because so well I love Lucentio.LUCENTIOTranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:And let me be a slave, to achieve that maidWhose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.Here comes the rogue.Enter BIONDELLOSirrah, where have you been?BIONDELLOWhere have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Oryou stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?LUCENTIOSirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,And therefore frame your manners to the time.Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,Puts my apparel and my countenance on,And I for my escape have put on his;For in a quarrel since I came ashoreI kill'd a man and fear I was descried:Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,While I make way from hence to save my life:You understand me?BIONDELLOI, sir! ne'er a whit.LUCENTIOAnd not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:Tranio is changed into Lucentio.BIONDELLOThe better for him: would I were so too!TRANIOSo could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I adviseYou use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;But in all places else your master Lucentio.LUCENTIOTranio, let's go: one thing more rests, thatthyself execute, to make one among these wooers: ifthou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both goodand weighty.ExeuntThe presenters above speakFirst ServantMy lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.SLYYes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:comes there any more of it?PageMy lord, 'tis but begun.SLY'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:would 'twere done!They sit and markSCENE II. Padua.

I should knockyou first,And then I know after who comes by the worst.PETRUCHIOWill it not be?Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.He wrings him by the earsGRUMIOHelp, masters, help! my master is mad.PETRUCHIONow, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!Enter HORTENSIOHORTENSIOHow now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?PETRUCHIOSignior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.HORTENSIO'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signormio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compoundthis quarrel.GRUMIONay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.if this be not a lawful case for me to leave hisservice, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and raphim soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant touse his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I hadwell knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.PETRUCHIOA senseless villain! Good Hortensio,I bade the rascal knock upon your gateAnd could not get him for my heart to do it.GRUMIOKnock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not thesewords plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come younow with, 'knocking at the gate'?PETRUCHIOSirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.HORTENSIOPetruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy galeBlows you to Padua here from old Verona?PETRUCHIOSuch wind as scatters young men through the world,To seek their fortunes farther than at homeWhere small experience grows. But in a few,Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:Antonio, my father, is deceased;And I have thrust myself into this maze,Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,And so am come abroad to see the world.HORTENSIOPetruchio, shall I then come roundly to theeAnd wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:And yet I'll promise thee she shall be richAnd very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,And I'll not wish thee to her.PETRUCHIOSignior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as weFew words suffice; and therefore, if thou knowOne rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewdAs Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,She moves me not, or not removes, at least,Affection's edge in me, were she as roughAs are the swelling Adriatic seas:I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;If wealthily, then happily in Padua.GRUMIONay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what hismind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him toa puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'era tooth in her head, though she have as many diseasesas two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,so money comes withal.HORTENSIOPetruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,I will continue that I broach'd in jest.I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wifeWith wealth enough and young and beauteous,Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:Her only fault, and that is faults enough,Is that she is intolerable curstAnd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measureThat, were my state far worser than it is,I would not wed her for a mine of gold.PETRUCHIOHortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;For I will board her, though she chide as loudAs thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.HORTENSIOHer father is Baptista Minola,An affable and courteous gentleman:Her name is Katharina Minola,Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.PETRUCHIOI know her father, though I know not her;And he knew my deceased father well.I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;And therefore let me be thus bold with youTo give you over at this first encounter,Unless you will accompany me thither.GRUMIOI pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, shewould think scolding would do little good upon him:she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail inhis rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an shestand him but a little, he will throw a figure inher face and so disfigure her with it that sheshall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.You know him not, sir.HORTENSIOTarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:He hath the jewel of my life in hold,His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,And her withholds from me and other more,Suitors to her and rivals in my love,Supposing it a thing impossible,For those defects I have before rehearsed,That ever Katharina will be woo'd;Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,That none shall have access unto BiancaTill Katharina the curst have got a husband.GRUMIOKatharina the curst!A title for a maid of all titles the worst.HORTENSIONow shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,And offer me disguised in sober robesTo old Baptista as a schoolmasterWell seen in music, to instruct Bianca;That so I may, by this device, at leastHave leave and leisure to make love to herAnd unsuspected court her by herself.GRUMIOHere's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,how the young folks lay their heads together!Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguisedMaster, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?HORTENSIOPeace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.Petruchio, stand by a while.GRUMIOA proper stripling and an amorous!GREMIOO, very well; I have perused the note.Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:All books of love, see that at any hand;And see you read no other lectures to her:You understand me: over and besideSignior Baptista's liberality,I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,And let me have them very well perfumedFor she is sweeter than perfume itselfTo whom they go to.

O vile,Intolerable, not to be endured!Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;Say, I command her to come to me.Exit GRUMIOHORTENSIOI know her answer.PETRUCHIOWhat?HORTENSIOShe will not.PETRUCHIOThe fouler fortune mine, and there an end.BAPTISTANow, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!Re-enter KATARINAKATHARINAWhat is your will, sir, that you send for me?PETRUCHIOWhere is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?KATHARINAThey sit conferring by the parlor fire.PETRUCHIOGo fetch them hither: if they deny to come.Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.Exit KATHARINALUCENTIOHere is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.HORTENSIOAnd so it is: I wonder what it bodes.PETRUCHIOMarry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,And awful rule and right supremacy;And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?BAPTISTANow, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!The wager thou hast won; and I will addUnto their losses twenty thousand crowns;Another dowry to another daughter,For she is changed, as she had never been.PETRUCHIONay, I will win my wager better yetAnd show more sign of her obedience,Her new-built virtue and obedience.See where she comes and brings your froward wivesAs prisoners to her womanly persuasion.Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and WidowKatharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.WidowLord, let me never have a cause to sigh,Till I be brought to such a silly pass!BIANCAFie! what a foolish duty call you this?LUCENTIOI would your duty were as foolish too:The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.BIANCAThe more fool you, for laying on my duty.PETRUCHIOKatharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong womenWhat duty they do owe their lords and husbands.WidowCome, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.PETRUCHIOCome on, I say; and first begin with her.WidowShe shall not.PETRUCHIOI say she shall: and first begin with her.KATHARINAFie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,And in no sense is meet or amiable.A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;And while it is so, none so dry or thirstyWill deign to sip or touch one drop of it.Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,And for thy maintenance commits his bodyTo painful labour both by sea and land,To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;And craves no other tribute at thy handsBut love, fair looks and true obedience;Too little payment for so great a debt.Such duty as the subject owes the princeEven such a woman oweth to her husband;And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,And not obedient to his honest will,What is she but a foul contending rebelAnd graceless traitor to her loving lord?I am ashamed that women are so simpleTo offer war where they should kneel for peace;Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,When they are bound to serve, love and obey.Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,But that our soft conditions and our heartsShould well agree with our external parts?Come, come, you froward and unable worms!My mind hath been as big as one of yours,My heart as great, my reason haply more,To bandy word for word and frown for frown;But now I see our lances are but straws,Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,And place your hands below your husband's foot:In token of which duty, if he please,My hand is ready; may it do him ease.PETRUCHIOWhy, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.LUCENTIOWell, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.VINCENTIO'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.LUCENTIOBut a harsh hearing when women are froward.PETRUCHIOCome, Kate, we'll to bed.We three are married, but you two are sped.To LUCENTIO'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;And, being a winner, God give you good night!Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINAHORTENSIONow, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.LUCENTIO'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.Exeunt
