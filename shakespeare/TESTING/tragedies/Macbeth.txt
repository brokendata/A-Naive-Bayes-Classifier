A camp near Forres.Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding SergeantDUNCANWhat bloody man is that? He can report,As seemeth by his plight, of the revoltThe newest state.MALCOLMThis is the sergeantWho like a good and hardy soldier fought'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!Say to the king the knowledge of the broilAs thou didst leave it.SergeantDoubtful it stood;As two spent swimmers, that do cling togetherAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--Worthy to be a rebel, for to thatThe multiplying villanies of natureDo swarm upon him--from the western islesOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,Which smoked with bloody execution,Like valour's minion carved out his passageTill he faced the slave;Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,And fix'd his head upon our battlements.DUNCANO valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!SergeantAs whence the sun 'gins his reflectionShipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to comeDiscomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:No sooner justice had with valour arm'dCompell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,With furbish'd arms and new supplies of menBegan a fresh assault.DUNCANDismay'd not thisOur captains, Macbeth and Banquo?SergeantYes;As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.If I say sooth, I must report they wereAs cannons overcharged with double cracks, so theyDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,Or memorise another Golgotha,I cannot tell.But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.DUNCANSo well thy words become thee as thy wounds;They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.Exit Sergeant, attendedWho comes here?Enter ROSSMALCOLMThe worthy thane of Ross.LENNOXWhat a haste looks through his eyes! So should he lookThat seems to speak things strange.ROSSGod save the king!DUNCANWhence camest thou, worthy thane?ROSSFrom Fife, great king;Where the Norweyan banners flout the skyAnd fan our people cold. Norway himself,With terrible numbers,Assisted by that most disloyal traitorThe thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,Confronted him with self-comparisons,Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,The victory fell on us.DUNCANGreat happiness!ROSSThat nowSweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:Nor would we deign him burial of his menTill he disbursed at Saint Colme's inchTen thousand dollars to our general use.DUNCANNo more that thane of Cawdor shall deceiveOur bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,And with his former title greet Macbeth.ROSSI'll see it done.DUNCANWhat he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.ExeuntSCENE III. A heath near Forres.Thunder. Enter the three WitchesFirst WitchWhere hast thou been, sister?Second WitchKilling swine.Third WitchSister, where thou?First WitchA sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--'Give me,' quoth I:'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:But in a sieve I'll thither sail,And, like a rat without a tail,I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.Second WitchI'll give thee a wind.First WitchThou'rt kind.Third WitchAnd I another.First WitchI myself have all the other,And the very ports they blow,All the quarters that they knowI' the shipman's card.I will drain him dry as hay:Sleep shall neither night nor dayHang upon his pent-house lid;He shall live a man forbid:Weary se'nnights nine times nineShall he dwindle, peak and pine:Though his bark cannot be lost,Yet it shall be tempest-tost.Look what I have.Second WitchShow me, show me.First WitchHere I have a pilot's thumb,Wreck'd as homeward he did come.Drum withinThird WitchA drum, a drum!Macbeth doth come.ALLThe weird sisters, hand in hand,Posters of the sea and land,Thus do go about, about:Thrice to thine and thrice to mineAnd thrice again, to make up nine.Peace! the charm's wound up.Enter MACBETH and BANQUOMACBETHSo foul and fair a day I have not seen.BANQUOHow far is't call'd to Forres? What are theseSo wither'd and so wild in their attire,That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aughtThat man may question? You seem to understand me,By each at once her chappy finger layingUpon her skinny lips: you should be women,And yet your beards forbid me to interpretThat you are so.MACBETHSpeak, if you can: what are you?First WitchAll hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!Second WitchAll hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!Third WitchAll hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!BANQUOGood sir, why do you start; and seem to fearThings that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,Are ye fantastical, or that indeedWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partnerYou greet with present grace and great predictionOf noble having and of royal hope,That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.If you can look into the seeds of time,And say which grain will grow and which will not,Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fearYour favours nor your hate.First WitchHail!Second WitchHail!Third WitchHail!First WitchLesser than Macbeth, and greater.Second WitchNot so happy, yet much happier.Third WitchThou shalt get kings, though thou be none:So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!First WitchBanquo and Macbeth, all hail!MACBETHStay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,A prosperous gentleman; and to be kingStands not within the prospect of belief,No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whenceYou owe this strange intelligence? or whyUpon this blasted heath you stop our wayWith such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.Witches vanishBANQUOThe earth hath bubbles, as the water has,And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?MACBETHInto the air; and what seem'd corporal meltedAs breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!BANQUOWere such things here as we do speak about?Or have we eaten on the insane rootThat takes the reason prisoner?MACBETHYour children shall be kings.BANQUOYou shall be king.MACBETHAnd thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?BANQUOTo the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?Enter ROSS and ANGUSROSSThe king hath happily received, Macbeth,The news of thy success; and when he readsThy personal venture in the rebels' fight,His wonders and his praises do contendWhich should be thine or his: silenced with that,In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,Strange images of death. As thick as hailCame post with post; and every one did bearThy praises in his kingdom's great defence,And pour'd them down before him.ANGUSWe are sentTo give thee from our royal master thanks;Only to herald thee into his sight,Not pay thee.ROSSAnd, for an earnest of a greater honour,He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!For it is thine.BANQUOWhat, can the devil speak true?MACBETHThe thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress meIn borrow'd robes?ANGUSWho was the thane lives yet;But under heavy judgment bears that lifeWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combinedWith those of Norway, or did line the rebelWith hidden help and vantage, or that with bothHe labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,Have overthrown him.MACBETH[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!The greatest is behind.To ROSS and ANGUSThanks for your pains.To BANQUODo you not hope your children shall be kings,When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to mePromised no less to them?BANQUOThat trusted homeMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,The instruments of darkness tell us truths,Win us with honest trifles, to betray'sIn deepest consequence.Cousins, a word, I pray you.MACBETH[Aside]	Two truths are told,As happy prologues to the swelling actOf the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.AsideCannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,Why hath it given me earnest of success,Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:If good, why do I yield to that suggestionWhose horrid image doth unfix my hairAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs,Against the use of nature? Present fearsAre less than horrible imaginings:My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,Shakes so my single state of man that functionIs smother'd in surmise, and nothing isBut what is not.BANQUOLook, how our partner's rapt.MACBETH[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,Without my stir.BANQUONew horrors come upon him,Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mouldBut with the aid of use.MACBETH[Aside]                Come what come may,Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.BANQUOWorthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.MACBETHGive me your favour: my dull brain was wroughtWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your painsAre register'd where every day I turnThe leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,The interim having weigh'd it, let us speakOur free hearts each to other.BANQUOVery gladly.MACBETHTill then, enough. Come, friends.ExeuntSCENE IV. Forres. The palace.Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and AttendantsDUNCANIs execution done on Cawdor? Are notThose in commission yet return'd?MALCOLMMy liege,They are not yet come back. But I have spokeWith one that saw him die: who did reportThat very frankly he confess'd his treasons,Implored your highness' pardon and set forthA deep repentance: nothing in his lifeBecame him like the leaving it; he diedAs one that had been studied in his deathTo throw away the dearest thing he owed,As 'twere a careless trifle.DUNCANThere's no artTo find the mind's construction in the face:He was a gentleman on whom I builtAn absolute trust.Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUSO worthiest cousin!The sin of my ingratitude even nowWas heavy on me: thou art so far beforeThat swiftest wing of recompense is slowTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,That the proportion both of thanks and paymentMight have been mine! only I have left to say,More is thy due than more than all can pay.MACBETHThe service and the loyalty I owe,In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' partIs to receive our duties; and our dutiesAre to your throne and state children and servants,Which do but what they should, by doing every thingSafe toward your love and honour.DUNCANWelcome hither:I have begun to plant thee, and will labourTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,That hast no less deserved, nor must be knownNo less to have done so, let me enfold theeAnd hold thee to my heart.BANQUOThere if I grow,The harvest is your own.DUNCANMy plenteous joys,Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselvesIn drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,And you whose places are the nearest, knowWe will establish our estate uponOur eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafterThe Prince of Cumberland; which honour mustNot unaccompanied invest him only,But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shineOn all deservers. From hence to Inverness,And bind us further to you.MACBETHThe rest is labour, which is not used for you:I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyfulThe hearing of my wife with your approach;So humbly take my leave.DUNCANMy worthy Cawdor!MACBETH[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a stepOn which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;Let not light see my black and deep desires:The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.ExitDUNCANTrue, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,And in his commendations I am fed;It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:It is a peerless kinsman.Flourish. ExeuntSCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letterLADY MACBETH'They met me in the day of success: and I havelearned by the perfectest report, they have more inthem than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desireto question them further, they made themselves air,into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt inthe wonder of it, came missives from the king, whoall-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referredme to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king thatshalt be!' This have I thought good to deliverthee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thoumightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by beingignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay itto thy heart, and farewell.'Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt beWhat thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;It is too full o' the milk of human kindnessTo catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;Art not without ambition, but withoutThe illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;And that which rather thou dost fear to doThan wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;And chastise with the valour of my tongueAll that impedes thee from the golden round,Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seemTo have thee crown'd withal.Enter a MessengerWhat is your tidings?MessengerThe king comes here to-night.LADY MACBETHThou'rt mad to say it:Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,Would have inform'd for preparation.MessengerSo please you, it is true: our thane is coming:One of my fellows had the speed of him,Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely moreThan would make up his message.LADY MACBETHGive him tending;He brings great news.Exit MessengerThe raven himself is hoarseThat croaks the fatal entrance of DuncanUnder my battlements. Come, you spiritsThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,And fill me from the crown to the toe top-fullOf direst cruelty! make thick my blood;Stop up the access and passage to remorse,That no compunctious visitings of natureShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace betweenThe effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,Wherever in your sightless substancesYou wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,To cry 'Hold, hold!'Enter MACBETHGreat Glamis! worthy Cawdor!Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!Thy letters have transported me beyondThis ignorant present, and I feel nowThe future in the instant.MACBETHMy dearest love,Duncan comes here to-night.LADY MACBETHAnd when goes hence?MACBETHTo-morrow, as he purposes.LADY MACBETHO, neverShall sun that morrow see!Your face, my thane, is as a book where menMay read strange matters. To beguile the time,Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,But be the serpent under't. He that's comingMust be provided for: and you shall putThis night's great business into my dispatch;Which shall to all our nights and days to comeGive solely sovereign sway and masterdom.MACBETHWe will speak further.LADY MACBETHOnly look up clear;To alter favour ever is to fear:Leave all the rest to me.ExeuntSCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM,  DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and AttendantsDUNCANThis castle hath a pleasant seat; the airNimbly and sweetly recommends itselfUnto our gentle senses.BANQUOThis guest of summer,The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breathSmells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this birdHath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,The air is delicate.Enter LADY MACBETHDUNCANSee, see, our honour'd hostess!The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach youHow you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,And thank us for your trouble.LADY MACBETHAll our serviceIn every point twice done and then done doubleWere poor and single business to contendAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewithYour majesty loads our house: for those of old,And the late dignities heap'd up to them,We rest your hermits.DUNCANWhere's the thane of Cawdor?We coursed him at the heels, and had a purposeTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp himTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,We are your guest to-night.LADY MACBETHYour servants everHave theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,Still to return your own.DUNCANGive me your hand;Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,And shall continue our graces towards him.By your leave, hostess.ExeuntSCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers  Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETHMACBETHIf it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere wellIt were done quickly: if the assassinationCould trammel up the consequence, and catchWith his surcease success; that but this blowMight be the be-all and the end-all here,But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,We'ld jump the life to come. But in these casesWe still have judgment here; that we but teachBloody instructions, which, being taught, returnTo plague the inventor: this even-handed justiceCommends the ingredients of our poison'd chaliceTo our own lips. He's here in double trust;First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,Who should against his murderer shut the door,Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this DuncanHath borne his faculties so meek, hath beenSo clear in his great office, that his virtuesWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, againstThe deep damnation of his taking-off;And pity, like a naked new-born babe,Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsedUpon the sightless couriers of the air,Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spurTo prick the sides of my intent, but onlyVaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itselfAnd falls on the other.Enter LADY MACBETHHow now! what news?LADY MACBETHHe has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?MACBETHHath he ask'd for me?LADY MACBETHKnow you not he has?MACBETHWe will proceed no further in this business:He hath honour'd me of late; and I have boughtGolden opinions from all sorts of people,Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,Not cast aside so soon.LADY MACBETHWas the hope drunkWherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?And wakes it now, to look so green and paleAt what it did so freely? From this timeSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeardTo be the same in thine own act and valourAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have thatWhich thou esteem'st the ornament of life,And live a coward in thine own esteem,Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'Like the poor cat i' the adage?MACBETHPrithee, peace:I dare do all that may become a man;Who dares do more is none.LADY MACBETHWhat beast was't, then,That made you break this enterprise to me?When you durst do it, then you were a man;And, to be more than what you were, you wouldBe so much more the man. Nor time nor placeDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:They have made themselves, and that their fitness nowDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and knowHow tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:I would, while it was smiling in my face,Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as youHave done to this.MACBETHIf we should fail?LADY MACBETHWe fail!But screw your courage to the sticking-place,And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journeySoundly invite him--his two chamberlainsWill I with wine and wassail so convinceThat memory, the warder of the brain,Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reasonA limbeck only: when in swinish sleepTheir drenched natures lie as in a death,What cannot you and I perform uponThe unguarded Duncan? what not put uponHis spongy officers, who shall bear the guiltOf our great quell?MACBETHBring forth men-children only;For thy undaunted mettle should composeNothing but males. Will it not be received,When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy twoOf his own chamber and used their very daggers,That they have done't?LADY MACBETHWho dares receive it other,As we shall make our griefs and clamour roarUpon his death?MACBETHI am settled, and bend upEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.Away, and mock the time with fairest show:False face must hide what the false heart doth know.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before himBANQUOHow goes the night, boy?FLEANCEThe moon is down; I have not heard the clock.BANQUOAnd she goes down at twelve.FLEANCEI take't, 'tis later, sir.BANQUOHold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that natureGives way to in repose!Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torchGive me my sword.Who's there?MACBETHA friend.BANQUOWhat, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:He hath been in unusual pleasure, andSent forth great largess to your offices.This diamond he greets your wife withal,By the name of most kind hostess; and shut upIn measureless content.MACBETHBeing unprepared,Our will became the servant to defect;Which else should free have wrought.BANQUOAll's well.I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:To you they have show'd some truth.MACBETHI think not of them:Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,We would spend it in some words upon that business,If you would grant the time.BANQUOAt your kind'st leisure.MACBETHIf you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,It shall make honour for you.BANQUOSo I lose noneIn seeking to augment it, but still keepMy bosom franchised and allegiance clear,I shall be counsell'd.MACBETHGood repose the while!BANQUOThanks, sir: the like to you!Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCEMACBETHGo bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.Exit ServantIs this a dagger which I see before me,The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.Art thou not, fatal vision, sensibleTo feeling as to sight? or art thou butA dagger of the mind, a false creation,Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?I see thee yet, in form as palpableAs this which now I draw.Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;And such an instrument I was to use.Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,Which was not so before. There's no such thing:It is the bloody business which informsThus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworldNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuseThe curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebratesPale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his designMoves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fearThy very stones prate of my whereabout,And take the present horror from the time,Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.A bell ringsI go, and it is done; the bell invites me.Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knellThat summons thee to heaven or to hell.ExitSCENE II. The same.Enter LADY MACBETHLADY MACBETHThat which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.Hark! Peace!It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:The doors are open; and the surfeited groomsDo mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'dtheir possets,That death and nature do contend about them,Whether they live or die.MACBETH[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!LADY MACBETHAlack, I am afraid they have awaked,And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deedConfounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembledMy father as he slept, I had done't.Enter MACBETHMy husband!MACBETHI have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?LADY MACBETHI heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.Did not you speak?MACBETHWhen?LADY MACBETHNow.MACBETHAs I descended?LADY MACBETHAy.MACBETHHark!Who lies i' the second chamber?LADY MACBETHDonalbain.MACBETHThis is a sorry sight.Looking on his handsLADY MACBETHA foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.MACBETHThere's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried'Murder!'That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:But they did say their prayers, and address'd themAgain to sleep.LADY MACBETHThere are two lodged together.MACBETHOne cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'When they did say 'God bless us!'LADY MACBETHConsider it not so deeply.MACBETHBut wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'Stuck in my throat.LADY MACBETHThese deeds must not be thoughtAfter these ways; so, it will make us mad.MACBETHMethought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,Chief nourisher in life's feast,--LADY MACBETHWhat do you mean?MACBETHStill it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore CawdorShall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'LADY MACBETHWho was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,You do unbend your noble strength, to thinkSo brainsickly of things. Go get some water,And wash this filthy witness from your hand.Why did you bring these daggers from the place?They must lie there: go carry them; and smearThe sleepy grooms with blood.MACBETHI'll go no more:I am afraid to think what I have done;Look on't again I dare not.LADY MACBETHInfirm of purpose!Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the deadAre but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhoodThat fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;For it must seem their guilt.Exit. Knocking withinMACBETHWhence is that knocking?How is't with me, when every noise appals me?What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this bloodClean from my hand? No, this my hand will ratherThe multitudinous seas in incarnadine,Making the green one red.Re-enter LADY MACBETHLADY MACBETHMy hands are of your colour; but I shameTo wear a heart so white.Knocking withinI hear a knockingAt the south entry: retire we to our chamber;A little water clears us of this deed:How easy is it, then! Your constancyHath left you unattended.Knocking withinHark! more knocking.Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,And show us to be watchers. Be not lostSo poorly in your thoughts.MACBETHTo know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.Knocking withinWake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!ExeuntSCENE III. The same.Knocking within.

Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;it provokes the desire, but it takesaway the performance: therefore, much drinkmay be said to be an equivocator with lechery:it makes him, and it mars him; it setshim on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,and disheartens him; makes him stand to, andnot stand to; in conclusion, equivocates himin a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.MACDUFFI believe drink gave thee the lie last night.PorterThat it did, sir, i' the very throat onme: but I requited him for his lie; and, Ithink, being too strong for him, though he tookup my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to casthim.MACDUFFIs thy master stirring?Enter MACBETHOur knocking has awaked him; here he comes.LENNOXGood morrow, noble sir.MACBETHGood morrow, both.MACDUFFIs the king stirring, worthy thane?MACBETHNot yet.MACDUFFHe did command me to call timely on him:I have almost slipp'd the hour.MACBETHI'll bring you to him.MACDUFFI know this is a joyful trouble to you;But yet 'tis one.MACBETHThe labour we delight in physics pain.This is the door.MACDUFFI'll make so bold to call,For 'tis my limited service.ExitLENNOXGoes the king hence to-day?MACBETHHe does: he did appoint so.LENNOXThe night has been unruly: where we lay,Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,And prophesying with accents terribleOf dire combustion and confused eventsNew hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure birdClamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earthWas feverous and did shake.MACBETH'Twas a rough night.LENNOXMy young remembrance cannot parallelA fellow to it.Re-enter MACDUFFMACDUFFO horror, horror, horror!

No man:The expedition my violent loveOutrun the pauser, reason.

On Tuesday last,A falcon, towering in her pride of place,Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.ROSSAnd Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would makeWar with mankind.Old Man'Tis said they eat each other.ROSSThey did so, to the amazement of mine eyesThat look'd upon't.

There is none but heWhose being I do fear: and, under him,My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sistersWhen first they put the name of king upon me,And bade them speak to him: then prophet-likeThey hail'd him father to a line of kings:Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;Put rancours in the vessel of my peaceOnly for them; and mine eternal jewelGiven to the common enemy of man,To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!Rather than so, come fate into the list.And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!Re-enter Attendant, with two MurderersNow go to the door, and stay there till we call.Exit AttendantWas it not yesterday we spoke together?First MurdererIt was, so please your highness.MACBETHWell then, nowHave you consider'd of my speeches? KnowThat it was he in the times past which held youSo under fortune, which you thought had beenOur innocent self: this I made good to youIn our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,the instruments,Who wrought with them, and all things else that mightTo half a soul and to a notion crazedSay 'Thus did Banquo.'First MurdererYou made it known to us.MACBETHI did so, and went further, which is nowOur point of second meeting. Do you findYour patience so predominant in your natureThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell'dTo pray for this good man and for his issue,Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the graveAnd beggar'd yours for ever?First MurdererWe are men, my liege.MACBETHAy, in the catalogue ye go for men;As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are cleptAll by the name of dogs: the valued fileDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,The housekeeper, the hunter, every oneAccording to the gift which bounteous natureHath in him closed; whereby he does receiveParticular addition. from the billThat writes them all alike: and so of men.Now, if you have a station in the file,Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;And I will put that business in your bosoms,Whose execution takes your enemy off,Grapples you to the heart and love of us,Who wear our health but sickly in his life,Which in his death were perfect.Second MurdererI am one, my liege,Whom the vile blows and buffets of the worldHave so incensed that I am reckless whatI do to spite the world.First MurdererAnd I anotherSo weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,That I would set my lie on any chance,To mend it, or be rid on't.MACBETHBoth of youKnow Banquo was your enemy.Both MurderersTrue, my lord.MACBETHSo is he mine; and in such bloody distance,That every minute of his being thrustsAgainst my near'st of life: and though I couldWith barefaced power sweep him from my sightAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,For certain friends that are both his and mine,Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fallWho I myself struck down; and thence it is,That I to your assistance do make love,Masking the business from the common eyeFor sundry weighty reasons.Second MurdererWe shall, my lord,Perform what you command us.First MurdererThough our lives--MACBETHYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at mostI will advise you where to plant yourselves;Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,And something from the palace; always thoughtThat I require a clearness: and with him--To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--Fleance his son, that keeps him company,Whose absence is no less material to meThan is his father's, must embrace the fateOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:I'll come to you anon.Both MurderersWe are resolved, my lord.MACBETHI'll call upon you straight: abide within.Exeunt MurderersIt is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.ExitSCENE II.

Things without all remedyShould be without regard: what's done is done.MACBETHWe have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor maliceRemains in danger of her former tooth.But let the frame of things disjoint, both theworlds suffer,Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleepIn the affliction of these terrible dreamsThat shake us nightly: better be with the dead,Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,Than on the torture of the mind to lieIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,Can touch him further.LADY MACBETHCome on;Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.MACBETHSo shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:Unsafe the while, that weMust lave our honours in these flattering streams,And make our faces vizards to our hearts,Disguising what they are.LADY MACBETHYou must leave this.MACBETHO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.LADY MACBETHBut in them nature's copy's not eterne.MACBETHThere's comfort yet; they are assailable;Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flownHis cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summonsThe shard-borne beetle with his drowsy humsHath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be doneA deed of dreadful note.LADY MACBETHWhat's to be done?MACBETHBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;And with thy bloody and invisible handCancel and tear to pieces that great bondWhich keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crowMakes wing to the rooky wood:Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.So, prithee, go with me.ExeuntSCENE III.

I hear horses.BANQUO[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!Second MurdererThen 'tis he: the restThat are within the note of expectationAlready are i' the court.First MurdererHis horses go about.Third MurdererAlmost a mile: but he does usually,So all men do, from hence to the palace gateMake it their walk.Second MurdererA light, a light!Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torchThird Murderer'Tis he.First MurdererStand to't.BANQUOIt will be rain to-night.First MurdererLet it come down.They set upon BANQUOBANQUOO, treachery!

But Banquo's safe?First MurdererAy, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,With twenty trenched gashes on his head;The least a death to nature.MACBETHThanks for that:There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fledHath nature that in time will venom breed,No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrowWe'll hear, ourselves, again.Exit MurdererLADY MACBETHMy royal lord,You do not give the cheer: the feast is soldThat is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;Meeting were bare without it.MACBETHSweet remembrancer!Now, good digestion wait on appetite,And health on both!LENNOXMay't please your highness sit.The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's placeMACBETHHere had we now our country's honour roof'd,Were the graced person of our Banquo present;Who may I rather challenge for unkindnessThan pity for mischance!ROSSHis absence, sir,Lays blame upon his promise.

Are you a man?MACBETHAy, and a bold one, that dare look on thatWhich might appal the devil.LADY MACBETHO proper stuff!This is the very painting of your fear:This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,Impostors to true fear, would well becomeA woman's story at a winter's fire,Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!Why do you make such faces? When all's done,You look but on a stool.MACBETHPrithee, see there! behold! look! lo!how say you?Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.If charnel-houses and our graves must sendThose that we bury back, our monumentsShall be the maws of kites.GHOST OF BANQUO vanishesLADY MACBETHWhat, quite unmann'd in folly?MACBETHIf I stand here, I saw him.LADY MACBETHFie, for shame!MACBETHBlood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'dToo terrible for the ear: the times have been,That, when the brains were out, the man would die,And there an end; but now they rise again,With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,And push us from our stools: this is more strangeThan such a murder is.LADY MACBETHMy worthy lord,Your noble friends do lack you.MACBETHI do forget.Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,I have a strange infirmity, which is nothingTo those that know me. Come, love and health to all;Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,And all to all.LordsOur duties, and the pledge.Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUOMACBETHAvaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;Thou hast no speculation in those eyesWhich thou dost glare with!LADY MACBETHThink of this, good peers,But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.MACBETHWhat man dare, I dare:Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;Take any shape but that, and my firm nervesShall never tremble: or be alive again,And dare me to the desert with thy sword;If trembling I inhabit then, protest meThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!Unreal mockery, hence!GHOST OF BANQUO vanishesWhy, so: being gone,I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.LADY MACBETHYou have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,With most admired disorder.MACBETHCan such things be,And overcome us like a summer's cloud,Without our special wonder? You make me strangeEven to the disposition that I owe,When now I think you can behold such sights,And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,When mine is blanched with fear.ROSSWhat sights, my lord?LADY MACBETHI pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;Question enrages him.

What is the night?LADY MACBETHAlmost at odds with morning, which is which.MACBETHHow say'st thou, that Macduff denies his personAt our great bidding?LADY MACBETHDid you send to him, sir?MACBETHI hear it by the way; but I will send:There's not a one of them but in his houseI keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,All causes shall give way: I am in bloodStepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,Returning were as tedious as go o'er:Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.LADY MACBETHYou lack the season of all natures, sleep.MACBETHCome, we'll to sleep.

The palace.Enter LENNOX and another LordLENNOXMy former speeches have but hit your thoughts,Which can interpret further: only, I say,Things have been strangely borne. Thegracious DuncanWas pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.Who cannot want the thought how monstrousIt was for Malcolm and for DonalbainTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straightIn pious rage the two delinquents tear,That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;For 'twould have anger'd any heart aliveTo hear the men deny't. So that, I say,He has borne all things well: and I do thinkThat had he Duncan's sons under his key--As, an't please heaven, he shall not--theyshould findWhat 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'dHis presence at the tyrant's feast, I hearMacduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tellWhere he bestows himself?LordThe son of Duncan,From whom this tyrant holds the due of birthLives in the English court, and is receivedOf the most pious Edward with such graceThat the malevolence of fortune nothingTakes from his high respect: thither MacduffIs gone to pray the holy king, upon his aidTo wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:That, by the help of these--with Him aboveTo ratify the work--we may againGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,Do faithful homage and receive free honours:All which we pine for now: and this reportHath so exasperate the king that hePrepares for some attempt of war.LENNOXSent he to Macduff?LordHe did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'The cloudy messenger turns me his back,And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the timeThat clogs me with this answer.'LENNOXAnd that well mightAdvise him to a caution, to hold what distanceHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angelFly to the court of England and unfoldHis message ere he come, that a swift blessingMay soon return to this our suffering countryUnder a hand accursed!LordI'll send my prayers with him.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I.

Macduff's castle.Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSSLADY MACDUFFWhat had he done, to make him fly the land?ROSSYou must have patience, madam.LADY MACDUFFHe had none:His flight was madness: when our actions do not,Our fears do make us traitors.ROSSYou know notWhether it was his wisdom or his fear.LADY MACDUFFWisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,His mansion and his titles in a placeFrom whence himself does fly? He loves us not;He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,The most diminutive of birds, will fight,Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.All is the fear and nothing is the love;As little is the wisdom, where the flightSo runs against all reason.ROSSMy dearest coz,I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knowsThe fits o' the season. I dare not speakmuch further;But cruel are the times, when we are traitorsAnd do not know ourselves, when we hold rumourFrom what we fear, yet know not what we fear,But float upon a wild and violent seaEach way and move. I take my leave of you:Shall not be long but I'll be here again:Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upwardTo what they were before. My pretty cousin,Blessing upon you!LADY MACDUFFFather'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.ROSSI am so much a fool, should I stay longer,It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:I take my leave at once.ExitLADY MACDUFFSirrah, your father's dead;And what will you do now?

Poor birds they are not set for.My father is not dead, for all your saying.LADY MACDUFFYes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?SonNay, how will you do for a husband?LADY MACDUFFWhy, I can buy me twenty at any market.SonThen you'll buy 'em to sell again.LADY MACDUFFThou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,With wit enough for thee.SonWas my father a traitor, mother?LADY MACDUFFAy, that he was.SonWhat is a traitor?LADY MACDUFFWhy, one that swears and lies.SonAnd be all traitors that do so?LADY MACDUFFEvery one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.SonAnd must they all be hanged that swear and lie?LADY MACDUFFEvery one.SonWho must hang them?LADY MACDUFFWhy,  the honest men.SonThen the liars and swearers are fools,for there are liars and swearers enow to beatthe honest men and hang up them.LADY MACDUFFNow, God help thee, poor monkey!But how wilt thou do for a father?SonIf he were dead, you'ld weep forhim: if you would not, it were a good signthat I should quickly have a new father.LADY MACDUFFPoor prattler, how thou talk'st!Enter a MessengerMessengerBless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,Though in your state of honour I am perfect.I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:If you will take a homely man's advice,Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;To do worse to you were fell cruelty,Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!I dare abide no longer.ExitLADY MACDUFFWhither should I fly?I have done no harm. But I remember nowI am in this earthly world; where to do harmIs often laudable, to do good sometimeAccounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,Do I put up that womanly defence,To say I have done no harm?Enter MurderersWhat are these faces?First MurdererWhere is your husband?LADY MACDUFFI hope, in no place so unsanctifiedWhere such as thou mayst find him.First MurdererHe's a traitor.SonThou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!First MurdererWhat, you egg!Stabbing himYoung fry of treachery!SonHe has kill'd me, mother:Run away, I pray you!DiesExit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following herSCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFFMALCOLMLet us seek out some desolate shade, and thereWeep our sad bosoms empty.MACDUFFLet us ratherHold fast the mortal sword, and like good menBestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new mornNew widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrowsStrike heaven on the face, that it resoundsAs if it felt with Scotland and yell'd outLike syllable of dolour.MALCOLMWhat I believe I'll wail,What know believe, and what I can redress,As I shall find the time to friend, I will.What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;but somethingYou may deserve of him through me, and wisdomTo offer up a weak poor innocent lambTo appease an angry god.MACDUFFI am not treacherous.MALCOLMBut Macbeth is.A good and virtuous nature may recoilIn an imperial charge. But I shall craveyour pardon;That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,Yet grace must still look so.MACDUFFI have lost my hopes.MALCOLMPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.Why in that rawness left you wife and child,Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,Without leave-taking? I pray you,Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,Whatever I shall think.MACDUFFBleed, bleed, poor country!Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thouthy wrongs;The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:I would not be the villain that thou think'stFor the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,And the rich East to boot.MALCOLMBe not offended:I speak not as in absolute fear of you.I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gashIs added to her wounds: I think withalThere would be hands uplifted in my right;And here from gracious England have I offerOf goodly thousands: but, for all this,When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor countryShall have more vices than it had before,More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,By him that shall succeed.MACDUFFWhat should he be?MALCOLMIt is myself I mean: in whom I knowAll the particulars of vice so graftedThat, when they shall be open'd, black MacbethWill seem as pure as snow, and the poor stateEsteem him as a lamb, being comparedWith my confineless harms.MACDUFFNot in the legionsOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn'dIn evils to top Macbeth.MALCOLMI grant him bloody,Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sinThat has a name: but there's no bottom, none,In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,Your matrons and your maids, could not fill upThe cistern of my lust, and my desireAll continent impediments would o'erbearThat did oppose my will: better MacbethThan such an one to reign.MACDUFFBoundless intemperanceIn nature is a tyranny; it hath beenThe untimely emptying of the happy throneAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yetTo take upon you what is yours: you mayConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.We have willing dames enough: there cannot beThat vulture in you, to devour so manyAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,Finding it so inclined.MALCOLMWith this there growsIn my most ill-composed affection suchA stanchless avarice that, were I king,I should cut off the nobles for their lands,Desire his jewels and this other's house:And my more-having would be as a sauceTo make me hunger more; that I should forgeQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,Destroying them for wealth.MACDUFFThis avariceSticks deeper, grows with more pernicious rootThan summer-seeming lust, and it hath beenThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.Of your mere own: all these are portable,With other graces weigh'd.MALCOLMBut I have none: the king-becoming graces,As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,I have no relish of them, but aboundIn the division of each several crime,Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I shouldPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,Uproar the universal peace, confoundAll unity on earth.MACDUFFO Scotland, Scotland!MALCOLMIf such a one be fit to govern, speak:I am as I have spoken.MACDUFFFit to govern!No, not to live. O nation miserable,With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,Since that the truest issue of thy throneBy his own interdiction stands accursed,And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal fatherWas a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!These evils thou repeat'st upon thyselfHave banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,Thy hope ends here!MALCOLMMacduff, this noble passion,Child of integrity, hath from my soulWiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughtsTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish MacbethBy many of these trains hath sought to win meInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks meFrom over-credulous haste: but God aboveDeal between thee and me! for even nowI put myself to thy direction, andUnspeak mine own detraction, here abjureThe taints and blames I laid upon myself,For strangers to my nature. I am yetUnknown to woman, never was forsworn,Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,At no time broke my faith, would not betrayThe devil to his fellow and delightNo less in truth than life: my first false speakingWas this upon myself: what I am truly,Is thine and my poor country's to command:Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,Already at a point, was setting forth.Now we'll together; and the chance of goodnessBe like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?MACDUFFSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once'Tis hard to reconcile.Enter a DoctorMALCOLMWell; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?DoctorAy, sir; there are a crew of wretched soulsThat stay his cure: their malady convincesThe great assay of art; but at his touch--Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--They presently amend.MALCOLMI thank you, doctor.Exit DoctorMACDUFFWhat's the disease he means?MALCOLM'Tis call'd the evil:A most miraculous work in this good king;Which often, since my here-remain in England,I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,The mere despair of surgery, he cures,Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,To the succeeding royalty he leavesThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,And sundry blessings hang about his throne,That speak him full of grace.Enter ROSSMACDUFFSee, who comes here?MALCOLMMy countryman; but yet I know him not.MACDUFFMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.MALCOLMI know him now. Good God, betimes removeThe means that makes us strangers!ROSSSir, amen.MACDUFFStands Scotland where it did?ROSSAlas, poor country!Almost afraid to know itself. It cannotBe call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the airAre made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seemsA modern ecstasy; the dead man's knellIs there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's livesExpire before the flowers in their caps,Dying or ere they sicken.MACDUFFO, relationToo nice, and yet too true!MALCOLMWhat's the newest grief?ROSSThat of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:Each minute teems a new one.MACDUFFHow does my wife?ROSSWhy, well.MACDUFFAnd all my children?ROSSWell too.MACDUFFThe tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?ROSSNo; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.MACDUFFBut not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?ROSSWhen I came hither to transport the tidings,Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumourOf many worthy fellows that were out;Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:Now is the time of help; your eye in ScotlandWould create soldiers, make our women fight,To doff their dire distresses.MALCOLMBe't their comfortWe are coming thither: gracious England hathLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;An older and a better soldier noneThat Christendom gives out.ROSSWould I could answerThis comfort with the like! But I have wordsThat would be howl'd out in the desert air,Where hearing should not latch them.MACDUFFWhat concern they?The general cause? or is it a fee-griefDue to some single breast?ROSSNo mind that's honestBut in it shares some woe; though the main partPertains to you alone.MACDUFFIf it be mine,Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.ROSSLet not your ears despise my tongue for ever,Which shall possess them with the heaviest soundThat ever yet they heard.MACDUFFHum! I guess at it.ROSSYour castle is surprised; your wife and babesSavagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,To add the death of you.MALCOLMMerciful heaven!What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speakWhispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.MACDUFFMy children too?ROSSWife, children, servants, allThat could be found.MACDUFFAnd I must be from thence!My wife kill'd too?ROSSI have said.MALCOLMBe comforted:Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,To cure this deadly grief.MACDUFFHe has no children. All my pretty ones?Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?What, all my pretty chickens and their damAt one fell swoop?MALCOLMDispute it like a man.MACDUFFI shall do so;But I must also feel it as a man:I cannot but remember such things were,That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,Not for their own demerits, but for mine,Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!MALCOLMBe this the whetstone of your sword: let griefConvert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.MACDUFFO, I could play the woman with mine eyesAnd braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,Cut short all intermission; front to frontBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,Heaven forgive him too!MALCOLMThis tune goes manly.Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;Our lack is nothing but our leave; MacbethIs ripe for shaking, and the powers abovePut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:The night is long that never finds the day.ExeuntACT VSCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-GentlewomanDoctorI have two nights watched with you, but can perceiveno truth in your report. When was it she last walked?GentlewomanSince his majesty went into the field, I have seenher rise from her bed, throw her night-gown uponher, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and againreturn to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.DoctorA great perturbation in nature, to receive at oncethe benefit of sleep, and do the effects ofwatching! In this slumbery agitation, besides herwalking and other actual performances, what, at anytime, have you heard her say?GentlewomanThat, sir, which I will not report after her.DoctorYou may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.GentlewomanNeither to you nor any one; having no witness toconfirm my speech.Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taperLo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.DoctorHow came she by that light?GentlewomanWhy, it stood by her: she has light by hercontinually; 'tis her command.DoctorYou see, her eyes are open.GentlewomanAy, but their sense is shut.DoctorWhat is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.GentlewomanIt is an accustomed action with her, to seem thuswashing her hands: I have known her continue inthis a quarter of an hour.LADY MACBETHYet here's a spot.DoctorHark! she speaks: I will set down what comes fromher, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.LADY MACBETHOut, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, mylord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need wefear who knows it, when none can call our power toaccount?--Yet who would have thought the old manto have had so much blood in him.DoctorDo you mark that?LADY MACBETHThe thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all withthis starting.DoctorGo to, go to; you have known what you should not.GentlewomanShe has spoke what she should not, I am sure ofthat: heaven knows what she has known.LADY MACBETHHere's the smell of the blood still: all theperfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this littlehand. Oh, oh, oh!DoctorWhat a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.GentlewomanI would not have such a heart in my bosom for thedignity of the whole body.DoctorWell, well, well,--GentlewomanPray God it be, sir.DoctorThis disease is beyond my practise: yet I have knownthose which have walked in their sleep who have diedholily in their beds.LADY MACBETHWash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not sopale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; hecannot come out on's grave.DoctorEven so?LADY MACBETHTo bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What'sdone cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!ExitDoctorWill she go now to bed?GentlewomanDirectly.DoctorFoul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deedsDo breed unnatural troubles: infected mindsTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:More needs she the divine than the physician.God, God forgive us all! Look after her;Remove from her the means of all annoyance,And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.I think, but dare not speak.GentlewomanGood night, good doctor.ExeuntSCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.Drum and colours.

Seyton!Enter SEYTONSEYTONWhat is your gracious pleasure?MACBETHWhat news more?SEYTONAll is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.MACBETHI'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.Give me my armour.SEYTON'Tis not needed yet.MACBETHI'll put it on.Send out more horses; skirr the country round;Hang those that talk of fear.

Within the castle.Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and coloursMACBETHHang out our banners on the outward walls;The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strengthWill laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lieTill famine and the ague eat them up:Were they not forced with those that should be ours,We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,And beat them backward home.A cry of women withinWhat is that noise?SEYTONIt is the cry of women, my good lord.ExitMACBETHI have almost forgot the taste of fears;The time has been, my senses would have cool'dTo hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hairWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stirAs life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughtsCannot once start me.Re-enter SEYTONWherefore was that cry?SEYTONThe queen, my lord, is dead.MACBETHShe should have died hereafter;There would have been a time for such a word.To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,Creeps in this petty pace from day to dayTo the last syllable of recorded time,And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!Life's but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stageAnd then is heard no more: it is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.Enter a MessengerThou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.MessengerGracious my lord,I should report that which I say I saw,But know not how to do it.MACBETHWell, say, sir.MessengerAs I did stand my watch upon the hill,I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,The wood began to move.MACBETHLiar and slave!MessengerLet me endure your wrath, if't be not so:Within this three mile may you see it coming;I say, a moving grove.MACBETHIf thou speak'st false,Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,I care not if thou dost for me as much.I pull in resolution, and beginTo doubt the equivocation of the fiendThat lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam woodDo come to Dunsinane:'  and now a woodComes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!If this which he avouches does appear,There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.I gin to be aweary of the sun,And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!At least we'll die with harness on our back.ExeuntSCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughsMALCOLMNow near enough: your leafy screens throw down.And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and weShall take upon 's what else remains to do,According to our order.SIWARDFare you well.Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.MACDUFFMake all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.ExeuntSCENE VII. Another part of the field.Alarums. Enter MACBETHMACBETHThey have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's heThat was not born of woman? Such a oneAm I to fear, or none.Enter YOUNG SIWARDYOUNG SIWARDWhat is thy name?MACBETHThou'lt be afraid to hear it.YOUNG SIWARDNo; though thou call'st thyself a hotter nameThan any is in hell.MACBETHMy name's Macbeth.YOUNG SIWARDThe devil himself could not pronounce a titleMore hateful to mine ear.MACBETHNo, nor more fearful.YOUNG SIWARDThou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my swordI'll prove the lie thou speak'st.They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slainMACBETHThou wast born of womanBut swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.ExitAlarums. Enter MACDUFFMACDUFFThat way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose armsAre hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edgeI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;By this great clatter, one of greatest noteSeems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!And more I beg not.Exit. AlarumsEnter MALCOLM and SIWARDSIWARDThis way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;The noble thanes do bravely in the war;The day almost itself professes yours,And little is to do.MALCOLMWe have met with foesThat strike beside us.SIWARDEnter, sir, the castle.Exeunt. AlarumsSCENE VIII. Another part of the field.Enter MACBETHMACBETHWhy should I play the Roman fool, and dieOn mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashesDo better upon them.Enter MACDUFFMACDUFFTurn, hell-hound, turn!MACBETHOf all men else I have avoided thee:But get thee back; my soul is too much chargedWith blood of thine already.MACDUFFI have no words:My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villainThan terms can give thee out!They fightMACBETHThou losest labour:As easy mayst thou the intrenchant airWith thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,To one of woman born.MACDUFFDespair thy charm;And let the angel whom thou still hast servedTell thee, Macduff was from his mother's wombUntimely ripp'd.MACBETHAccursed be that tongue that tells me so,For it hath cow'd my better part of man!And be these juggling fiends no more believed,That palter with us in a double sense;That keep the word of promise to our ear,And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.MACDUFFThen yield thee, coward,And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,Painted on a pole, and underwrit,'Here may you see the tyrant.'MACBETHI will not yield,To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,And to be baited with the rabble's curse.Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,And thou opposed, being of no woman born,Yet I will try the last. Before my bodyI throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'Exeunt, fighting. AlarumsRetreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and SoldiersMALCOLMI would the friends we miss were safe arrived.SIWARDSome must go off: and yet, by these I see,So great a day as this is cheaply bought.MALCOLMMacduff is missing, and your noble son.ROSSYour son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:He only lived but till he was a man;The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'dIn the unshrinking station where he fought,But like a man he died.SIWARDThen he is dead?ROSSAy, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrowMust not be measured by his worth, for thenIt hath no end.SIWARDHad he his hurts before?ROSSAy, on the front.SIWARDWhy then, God's soldier be he!Had I as many sons as I have hairs,I would not wish them to a fairer death:And so, his knell is knoll'd.MALCOLMHe's worth more sorrow,And that I'll spend for him.SIWARDHe's worth no moreThey say he parted well, and paid his score:And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's headMACDUFFHail, king! for so thou art: behold, where standsThe usurper's cursed head: the time is free:I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,That speak my salutation in their minds;Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:Hail, King of Scotland!ALLHail, King of Scotland!FlourishMALCOLMWe shall not spend a large expense of timeBefore we reckon with your several loves,And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,Henceforth be earls, the first that ever ScotlandIn such an honour named. What's more to do,Which would be planted newly with the time,As calling home our exiled friends abroadThat fled the snares of watchful tyranny;Producing forth the cruel ministersOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent handsTook off her life; this, and what needful elseThat calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,We will perform in measure, time and place:So, thanks to all at once and to each one,Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.Flourish.
