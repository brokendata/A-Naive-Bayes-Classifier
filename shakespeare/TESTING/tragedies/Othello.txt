ACT ISCENE I. Venice. A street.Enter RODERIGO and IAGORODERIGOTush! never tell me; I take it much unkindlyThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purseAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.IAGO'Sblood, but you will not hear me:If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.RODERIGOThou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.IAGODespise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,Evades them, with a bombast circumstanceHorribly stuff'd with epithets of war;And, in conclusion,Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,'I have already chose my officer.'And what was he?Forsooth, a great arithmetician,One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;That never set a squadron in the field,Nor the division of a battle knowsMore than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,Wherein the toged consuls can proposeAs masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proofAt Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other groundsChristian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'dBy debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.RODERIGOBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.IAGOWhy, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,Preferment goes by letter and affection,And not by old gradation, where each secondStood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,Whether I in any just term am affinedTo love the Moor.RODERIGOI would not follow him then.IAGOO, sir, content you;I follow him to serve my turn upon him:We cannot all be masters, nor all mastersCannot be truly follow'd. You shall markMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave,That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:Whip me such honest knaves. Others there areWho, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,Do well thrive by them and when they have linedtheir coatsDo themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,It is as sure as you are Roderigo,Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:In following him, I follow but myself;Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,But seeming so, for my peculiar end:For when my outward action doth demonstrateThe native act and figure of my heartIn compliment extern, 'tis not long afterBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeveFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.RODERIGOWhat a full fortune does the thicklips oweIf he can carry't thus!IAGOCall up her father,Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,As it may lose some colour.RODERIGOHere is her father's house; I'll call aloud.IAGODo, with like timorous accent and dire yellAs when, by night and negligence, the fireIs spied in populous cities.RODERIGOWhat, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!IAGOAwake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!Thieves! thieves!BRABANTIO appears above, at a windowBRABANTIOWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?What is the matter there?RODERIGOSignior, is all your family within?IAGOAre your doors lock'd?BRABANTIOWhy, wherefore ask you this?IAGO'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put onyour gown;Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;Even now, now, very now, an old black ramIs topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:Arise, I say.BRABANTIOWhat, have you lost your wits?RODERIGOMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?BRABANTIONot I	what are you?RODERIGOMy name is Roderigo.BRABANTIOThe worser welcome:I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:In honest plainness thou hast heard me sayMy daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,Being full of supper and distempering draughts,Upon malicious bravery, dost thou comeTo start my quiet.RODERIGOSir, sir, sir,--BRABANTIOBut thou must needs be sureMy spirit and my place have in them powerTo make this bitter to thee.RODERIGOPatience, good sir.BRABANTIOWhat tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;My house is not a grange.RODERIGOMost grave Brabantio,In simple and pure soul I come to you.IAGO'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will notserve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come todo you service and you think we are ruffians, you'llhave your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll havecoursers for cousins and gennets for germans.BRABANTIOWhat profane wretch art thou?IAGOI am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughterand the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.BRABANTIOThou art a villain.IAGOYou are--a senator.BRABANTIOThis thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.RODERIGOSir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,Transported, with no worse nor better guardBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--If this be known to you and your allowance,We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;But if you know not this, my manners tell meWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believeThat, from the sense of all civility,I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,I say again, hath made a gross revolt;Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunesIn an extravagant and wheeling strangerOf here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:If she be in her chamber or your house,Let loose on me the justice of the stateFor thus deluding you.BRABANTIOStrike on the tinder, ho!Give me a taper! call up all my people!This accident is not unlike my dream:Belief of it oppresses me already.Light, I say! light!Exit aboveIAGOFarewell; for I must leave you:It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,However this may gall him with some cheque,Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'dWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,Another of his fathom they have none,To lead their business: in which regard,Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.Yet, for necessity of present life,I must show out a flag and sign of love,Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;And there will I be with him. So, farewell.ExitEnter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torchesBRABANTIOIt is too true an evil: gone she is;And what's to come of my despised timeIs nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives mePast thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?RODERIGOTruly, I think they are.BRABANTIOO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' mindsBy what you see them act. Is there not charmsBy which the property of youth and maidhoodMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,Of some such thing?RODERIGOYes, sir, I have indeed.BRABANTIOCall up my brother. O, would you had had her!Some one way, some another. Do you knowWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?RODERIGOI think I can discover him, if you please,To get good guard and go along with me.BRABANTIOPray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!And raise some special officers of night.On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.ExeuntSCENE II. Another street.Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torchesIAGOThough in the trade of war I have slain men,Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscienceTo do no contrived murder: I lack iniquitySometimes to do me service: nine or ten timesI had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.OTHELLO'Tis better as it is.IAGONay, but he prated,And spoke such scurvy and provoking termsAgainst your honourThat, with the little godliness I have,I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,Are you fast married? Be assured of this,That the magnifico is much beloved,And hath in his effect a voice potentialAs double as the duke's: he will divorce you;Or put upon you what restraint and grievanceThe law, with all his might to enforce it on,Will give him cable.OTHELLOLet him do his spite:My services which I have done the signioryShall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and beingFrom men of royal siege, and my demeritsMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortuneAs this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,But that I love the gentle Desdemona,I would not my unhoused free conditionPut into circumscription and confineFor the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?IAGOThose are the raised father and his friends:You were best go in.OTHELLONot I	I must be found:My parts, my title and my perfect soulShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?IAGOBy Janus, I think no.Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torchesOTHELLOThe servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.The goodness of the night upon you, friends!What is the news?CASSIOThe duke does greet you, general,And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,Even on the instant.OTHELLOWhat is the matter, think you?CASSIOSomething from Cyprus as I may divine:It is a business of some heat: the galleysHave sent a dozen sequent messengersThis very night at one another's heels,And many of the consuls, raised and met,Are at the duke's already: you have beenhotly call'd for;When, being not at your lodging to be found,The senate hath sent about three several guestsTo search you out.OTHELLO'Tis well I am found by you.I will but spend a word here in the house,And go with you.ExitCASSIOAncient, what makes he here?IAGO'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.CASSIOI do not understand.IAGOHe's married.CASSIOTo who?Re-enter OTHELLOIAGOMarry, to--Come, captain, will you go?OTHELLOHave with you.CASSIOHere comes another troop to seek for you.IAGOIt is Brabantio. General, be advised;He comes to bad intent.Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weaponsOTHELLOHolla! stand there!RODERIGOSignior, it is the Moor.BRABANTIODown with him, thief!They draw on both sidesIAGOYou, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.OTHELLOKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.Good signior, you shall more command with yearsThan with your weapons.BRABANTIOO thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;For I'll refer me to all things of sense,If she in chains of magic were not bound,Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,So opposite to marriage that she shunnedThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,Would ever have, to incur a general mock,Run from her guardage to the sooty bosomOf such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in senseThat thou hast practised on her with foul charms,Abused her delicate youth with drugs or mineralsThat weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.I therefore apprehend and do attach theeFor an abuser of the world, a practiserOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,Subdue him at his peril.OTHELLOHold your hands,Both you of my inclining, and the rest:Were it my cue to fight, I should have known itWithout a prompter. Where will you that I goTo answer this your charge?BRABANTIOTo prison, till fit timeOf law and course of direct sessionCall thee to answer.OTHELLOWhat if I do obey?How may the duke be therewith satisfied,Whose messengers are here about my side,Upon some present business of the stateTo bring me to him?First Officer'Tis true, most worthy signior;The duke's in council and your noble self,I am sure, is sent for.BRABANTIOHow! the duke in council!In this time of the night! Bring him away:Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,Or any of my brothers of the state,Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;For if such actions may have passage free,Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.ExeuntSCENE III. A council-chamber.The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attendingDUKE OF VENICEThere is no composition in these newsThat gives them credit.First SenatorIndeed, they are disproportion'd;My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.DUKE OF VENICEAnd mine, a hundred and forty.Second SenatorAnd mine, two hundred:But though they jump not on a just account,--As in these cases, where the aim reports,'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirmA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.DUKE OF VENICENay, it is possible enough to judgment:I do not so secure me in the error,But the main article I do approveIn fearful sense.Sailor[Within]  What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!First OfficerA messenger from the galleys.Enter a SailorDUKE OF VENICENow, what's the business?SailorThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;So was I bid report here to the stateBy Signior Angelo.DUKE OF VENICEHow say you by this change?First SenatorThis cannot be,By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,To keep us in false gaze. When we considerThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,And let ourselves again but understand,That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,So may he with more facile question bear it,For that it stands not in such warlike brace,But altogether lacks the abilitiesThat Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,We must not think the Turk is so unskilfulTo leave that latest which concerns him first,Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,To wake and wage a danger profitless.DUKE OF VENICENay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.First OfficerHere is more news.Enter a MessengerMessengerThe Ottomites, reverend and gracious,Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,Have there injointed them with an after fleet.First SenatorAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?MessengerOf thirty sail: and now they do restemTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearanceTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,Your trusty and most valiant servitor,With his free duty recommends you thus,And prays you to believe him.DUKE OF VENICE'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?First SenatorHe's now in Florence.DUKE OF VENICEWrite from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.First SenatorHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and OfficersDUKE OF VENICEValiant Othello, we must straight employ youAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.To BRABANTIOI did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.BRABANTIOSo did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;Neither my place nor aught I heard of businessHath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general careTake hold on me, for my particular griefIs of so flood-gate and o'erbearing natureThat it engluts and swallows other sorrowsAnd it is still itself.DUKE OF VENICEWhy, what's the matter?BRABANTIOMy daughter! O, my daughter!DUKE OF VENICESenatorDead?BRABANTIOAy, to me;She is abused, stol'n from me, and corruptedBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;For nature so preposterously to err,Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,Sans witchcraft could not.DUKE OF VENICEWhoe'er he be that in this foul proceedingHath thus beguiled your daughter of herselfAnd you of her, the bloody book of lawYou shall yourself read in the bitter letterAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper sonStood in your action.BRABANTIOHumbly I thank your grace.Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,Your special mandate for the state-affairsHath hither brought.DUKE OF VENICESenatorWe are very sorry for't.DUKE OF VENICE[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?BRABANTIONothing, but this is so.OTHELLOMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,My very noble and approved good masters,That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,It is most true; true, I have married her:The very head and front of my offendingHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,Till now some nine moons wasted, they have usedTheir dearest action in the tented field,And little of this great world can I speak,More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,And therefore little shall I grace my causeIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliverOf my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,What conjuration and what mighty magic,For such proceeding I am charged withal,I won his daughter.BRABANTIOA maiden never bold;Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motionBlush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,Of years, of country, credit, every thing,To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfectThat will confess perfection so could errAgainst all rules of nature, and must be drivenTo find out practises of cunning hell,Why this should be. I therefore vouch againThat with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,Or with some dram conjured to this effect,He wrought upon her.DUKE OF VENICETo vouch this, is no proof,Without more wider and more overt testThan these thin habits and poor likelihoodsOf modern seeming do prefer against him.First SenatorBut, Othello, speak:Did you by indirect and forced coursesSubdue and poison this young maid's affections?Or came it by request and such fair questionAs soul to soul affordeth?OTHELLOI do beseech you,Send for the lady to the Sagittary,And let her speak of me before her father:If you do find me foul in her report,The trust, the office I do hold of you,Not only take away, but let your sentenceEven fall upon my life.DUKE OF VENICEFetch Desdemona hither.OTHELLOAncient, conduct them: you best know the place.Exeunt IAGO and AttendantsAnd, till she come, as truly as to heavenI do confess the vices of my blood,So justly to your grave ears I'll presentHow I did thrive in this fair lady's love,And she in mine.DUKE OF VENICESay it, Othello.OTHELLOHer father loved me; oft invited me;Still question'd me the story of my life,From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,That I have passed.I ran it through, even from my boyish days,To the very moment that he bade me tell it;Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,Of moving accidents by flood and fieldOf hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,Of being taken by the insolent foeAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thenceAnd portance in my travels' history:Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heavenIt was my hint to speak,--such was the process;And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hearWould Desdemona seriously incline:But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,She'ld come again, and with a greedy earDevour up my discourse: which I observing,Took once a pliant hour, and found good meansTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heartThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,Whereof by parcels she had something heard,But not intentively: I did consent,And often did beguile her of her tears,When I did speak of some distressful strokeThat my youth suffer'd. My story being done,She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'dThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,I should but teach him how to tell my story.And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,And I loved her that she did pity them.This only is the witchcraft I have used:Here comes the lady; let her witness it.Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and AttendantsDUKE OF VENICEI think this tale would win my daughter too.Good Brabantio,Take up this mangled matter at the best:Men do their broken weapons rather useThan their bare hands.BRABANTIOI pray you, hear her speak:If she confess that she was half the wooer,Destruction on my head, if my bad blameLight on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:Do you perceive in all this noble companyWhere most you owe obedience?DESDEMONAMy noble father,I do perceive here a divided duty:To you I am bound for life and education;My life and education both do learn meHow to respect you; you are the lord of duty;I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,And so much duty as my mother show'dTo you, preferring you before her father,So much I challenge that I may professDue to the Moor my lord.BRABANTIOGod be wi' you! I have done.Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:I had rather to adopt a child than get it.Come hither, Moor:I here do give thee that with all my heartWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heartI would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,I am glad at soul I have no other child:For thy escape would teach me tyranny,To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.DUKE OF VENICELet me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,Which, as a grise or step, may help these loversInto your favour.When remedies are past, the griefs are endedBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.To mourn a mischief that is past and goneIs the next way to draw new mischief on.What cannot be preserved when fortune takesPatience her injury a mockery makes.The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.BRABANTIOSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;We lose it not, so long as we can smile.He bears the sentence well that nothing bearsBut the free comfort which from thence he hears,But he bears both the sentence and the sorrowThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:But words are words; I never yet did hearThat the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.DUKE OF VENICEThe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes forCyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is bestknown to you; and though we have there a substituteof most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, asovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safervoice on you: you must therefore be content toslubber the gloss of your new fortunes with thismore stubborn and boisterous expedition.OTHELLOThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,Hath made the flinty and steel couch of warMy thrice-driven bed of down: I do agniseA natural and prompt alacrityI find in hardness, and do undertakeThese present wars against the Ottomites.Most humbly therefore bending to your state,I crave fit disposition for my wife.Due reference of place and exhibition,With such accommodation and besortAs levels with her breeding.DUKE OF VENICEIf you please,Be't at her father's.BRABANTIOI'll not have it so.OTHELLONor I.DESDEMONANor I; I would not there reside,To put my father in impatient thoughtsBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;And let me find a charter in your voice,To assist my simpleness.DUKE OF VENICEWhat would You, Desdemona?DESDEMONAThat I did love the Moor to live with him,My downright violence and storm of fortunesMay trumpet to the world: my heart's subduedEven to the very quality of my lord:I saw Othello's visage in his mind,And to his honour and his valiant partsDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,A moth of peace, and he go to the war,The rites for which I love him are bereft me,And I a heavy interim shall supportBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.OTHELLOLet her have your voices.Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,To please the palate of my appetite,Nor to comply with heat--the young affectsIn me defunct--and proper satisfaction.But to be free and bounteous to her mind:And heaven defend your good souls, that you thinkI will your serious and great business scantFor she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toysOf feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullnessMy speculative and officed instruments,That my disports corrupt and taint my business,Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,And all indign and base adversitiesMake head against my estimation!DUKE OF VENICEBe it as you shall privately determine,Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,And speed must answer it.First SenatorYou must away to-night.OTHELLOWith all my heart.DUKE OF VENICEAt nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.Othello, leave some officer behind,And he shall our commission bring to you;With such things else of quality and respectAs doth import you.OTHELLOSo please your grace, my ancient;A man he is of honest and trust:To his conveyance I assign my wife,With what else needful your good grace shall thinkTo be sent after me.DUKE OF VENICELet it be so.Good night to every one.To BRABANTIOAnd, noble signior,If virtue no delighted beauty lack,Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.First SenatorAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.BRABANTIOLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:She has deceived her father, and may thee.Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers,  & cOTHELLOMy life upon her faith! Honest Iago,My Desdemona must I leave to thee:I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:And bring them after in the best advantage.Come, Desdemona: I have but an hourOf love, of worldly matters and direction,To spend with thee: we must obey the time.Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONARODERIGOIago,--IAGOWhat say'st thou, noble heart?RODERIGOWhat will I do, thinkest thou?IAGOWhy, go to bed, and sleep.RODERIGOI will incontinently drown myself.IAGOIf thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,thou silly gentleman!RODERIGOIt is silliness to live when to live is torment; andthen have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.IAGOO villainous! I have looked upon the world for fourtimes seven years; and since I could distinguishbetwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found manthat knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, Iwould drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, Iwould change my humanity with a baboon.RODERIGOWhat should I do? I confess it is my shame to be sofond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.IAGOVirtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thusor thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the whichour wills are gardeners: so that if we will plantnettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed upthyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, ordistract it with many, either to have it sterilewith idleness, or manured with industry, why, thepower and corrigible authority of this lies in ourwills. If the balance of our lives had not onescale of reason to poise another of sensuality, theblood and baseness of our natures would conduct usto most preposterous conclusions: but we havereason to cool our raging motions, our carnalstings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this thatyou call love to be a sect or scion.RODERIGOIt cannot be.IAGOIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission ofthe will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drowncats and blind puppies. I have professed me thyfriend and I confess me knit to thy deserving withcables of perdurable toughness; I could neverbetter stead thee than now. Put money in thypurse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour withan usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. Itcannot be that Desdemona should long continue herlove to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor hehis to her: it was a violent commencement, and thoushalt see an answerable sequestration:--put butmoney in thy purse. These Moors are changeable intheir wills: fill thy purse with money:--the foodthat to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall beto him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She mustchange for youth: when she is sated with his body,she will find the error of her choice: she musthave change, she must: therefore put money in thypurse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it amore delicate way than drowning. Make all the moneythou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixtan erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian nottoo hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thoushalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox ofdrowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seekthou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy thanto be drowned and go without her.RODERIGOWilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend onthe issue?IAGOThou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have toldthee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, Ihate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath noless reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revengeagainst him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dostthyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are manyevents in the womb of time which will be delivered.Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have moreof this to-morrow. Adieu.RODERIGOWhere shall we meet i' the morning?IAGOAt my lodging.RODERIGOI'll be with thee betimes.IAGOGo to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?RODERIGOWhat say you?IAGONo more of drowning, do you hear?RODERIGOI am changed: I'll go sell all my land.ExitIAGOThus do I ever make my fool my purse:For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,If I would time expend with such a snipe.But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheetsHe has done my office: I know not if't be true;But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;The better shall my purpose work on him.Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:To get his place and to plume up my willIn double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--After some time, to abuse Othello's earThat he is too familiar with his wife.He hath a person and a smooth disposeTo be suspected, framed to make women false.The Moor is of a free and open nature,That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,And will as tenderly be led by the noseAs asses are.I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and nightMust bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.ExitACT IISCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.Enter MONTANO and two GentlemenMONTANOWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?First GentlemanNothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,Descry a sail.MONTANOMethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?Second GentlemanA segregation of the Turkish fleet:For do but stand upon the foaming shore,The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,seems to cast water on the burning bear,And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:I never did like molestation viewOn the enchafed flood.MONTANOIf that the Turkish fleetBe not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:It is impossible they bear it out.Enter a third GentlemanThird GentlemanNews, lads! our wars are done.The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,That their designment halts: a noble ship of VeniceHath seen a grievous wreck and sufferanceOn most part of their fleet.MONTANOHow! is this true?Third GentlemanThe ship is here put in,A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,And is in full commission here for Cyprus.MONTANOI am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.Third GentlemanBut this same Cassio, though he speak of comfortTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,And prays the Moor be safe; for they were partedWith foul and violent tempest.MONTANOPray heavens he be;For I have served him, and the man commandsLike a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!As well to see the vessel that's come inAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,Even till we make the main and the aerial blueAn indistinct regard.Third GentlemanCome, let's do so:For every minute is expectancyOf more arrivance.Enter CASSIOCASSIOThanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavensGive him defence against the elements,For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.MONTANOIs he well shipp'd?CASSIOHis bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilotOf very expert and approved allowance;Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,Stand in bold cure.A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'Enter a fourth GentlemanCASSIOWhat noise?Fourth GentlemanThe town is empty; on the brow o' the seaStand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'CASSIOMy hopes do shape him for the governor.Guns heardSecond GentlemenThey do discharge their shot of courtesy:Our friends at least.CASSIOI pray you, sir, go forth,And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.Second GentlemanI shall.ExitMONTANOBut, good lieutenant, is your general wived?CASSIOMost fortunately: he hath achieved a maidThat paragons description and wild fame;One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,And in the essential vesture of creationDoes tire the ingener.Re-enter second GentlemanHow now! who has put in?Second Gentleman'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.CASSIOHas had most favourable and happy speed:Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--As having sense of beauty, do omitTheir mortal natures, letting go safely byThe divine Desdemona.MONTANOWhat is she?CASSIOShe that I spake of, our great captain's captain,Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,Whose footing here anticipates our thoughtsA se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,Give renew'd fire to our extincted spiritsAnd bring all Cyprus comfort!Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and AttendantsO, behold,The riches of the ship is come on shore!Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,Before, behind thee, and on every hand,Enwheel thee round!DESDEMONAI thank you, valiant Cassio.What tidings can you tell me of my lord?CASSIOHe is not yet arrived: nor know I aughtBut that he's well and will be shortly here.DESDEMONAO, but I fear--How lost you company?CASSIOThe great contention of the sea and skiesParted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heardSecond GentlemanThey give their greeting to the citadel;This likewise is a friend.CASSIOSee for the news.Exit GentlemanGood ancient, you are welcome.To EMILIAWelcome, mistress.Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,That I extend my manners; 'tis my breedingThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.Kissing herIAGOSir, would she give you so much of her lipsAs of her tongue she oft bestows on me,You'll have enough.DESDEMONAAlas, she has no speech.IAGOIn faith, too much;I find it still, when I have list to sleep:Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,She puts her tongue a little in her heart,And chides with thinking.EMILIAYou have little cause to say so.IAGOCome on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.DESDEMONAO, fie upon thee, slanderer!IAGONay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:You rise to play and go to bed to work.EMILIAYou shall not write my praise.IAGONo, let me not.DESDEMONAWhat wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldstpraise me?IAGOO gentle lady, do not put me to't;For I am nothing, if not critical.DESDEMONACome on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?IAGOAy, madam.DESDEMONAI am not merry; but I do beguileThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise.Come, how wouldst thou praise me?IAGOI am about it; but indeed my inventionComes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,And thus she is deliver'd.If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,The one's for use, the other useth it.DESDEMONAWell praised! How if she be black and witty?IAGOIf she be black, and thereto have a wit,She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.DESDEMONAWorse and worse.EMILIAHow if fair and foolish?IAGOShe never yet was foolish that was fair;For even her folly help'd her to an heir.DESDEMONAThese are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou forher that's foul and foolish?IAGOThere's none so foul and foolish thereunto,But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.DESDEMONAO heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deservingwoman indeed, one that, in the authority of hermerit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?IAGOShe that was ever fair and never proud,Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,She that in wisdom never was so frailTo change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,See suitors following and not look behind,She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--DESDEMONATo do what?IAGOTo suckle fools and chronicle small beer.DESDEMONAO most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learnof him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How sayyou, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberalcounsellor?CASSIOHe speaks home, madam: You may relish him more inthe soldier than in the scholar.IAGO[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,whisper: with as little a web as this will Iensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile uponher, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks asthese strip you out of your lieutenantry, it hadbeen better you had not kissed your three fingers sooft, which now again you are most apt to play thesir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellentcourtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingersto your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!Trumpet withinThe Moor! I know his trumpet.CASSIO'Tis truly so.DESDEMONALet's meet him and receive him.CASSIOLo, where he comes!Enter OTHELLO and AttendantsOTHELLOO my fair warrior!DESDEMONAMy dear Othello!OTHELLOIt gives me wonder great as my contentTo see you here before me. O my soul's joy!If after every tempest come such calms,May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!And let the labouring bark climb hills of seasOlympus-high and duck again as lowAs hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,My soul hath her content so absoluteThat not another comfort like to thisSucceeds in unknown fate.DESDEMONAThe heavens forbidBut that our loves and comforts should increase,Even as our days do grow!OTHELLOAmen to that, sweet powers!I cannot speak enough of this content;It stops me here; it is too much of joy:And this, and this, the greatest discords beKissing herThat e'er our hearts shall make!IAGO[Aside]  O, you are well tuned now!But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,As honest as I am.OTHELLOCome, let us to the castle.News, friends; our wars are done, the Turksare drown'd.How does my old acquaintance of this isle?Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,I prattle out of fashion, and I doteIn mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:Bring thou the master to the citadel;He is a good one, and his worthinessDoes challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,Once more, well met at Cyprus.Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and AttendantsIAGODo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Comehither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, basemen being in love have then a nobility in theirnatures more than is native to them--list me. Thelieutenant tonight watches on the court ofguard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona isdirectly in love with him.RODERIGOWith him! why, 'tis not possible.IAGOLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:and will she love him still for prating? let notthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;and what delight shall she have to look on thedevil? When the blood is made dull with the act ofsport, there should be, again to inflame it and togive satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all whichthe Moor is defective in: now, for want of theserequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness willfind itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature willinstruct her in it and compel her to some secondchoice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a mostpregnant and unforced position--who stands soeminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassiodoes? a knave very voluble; no furtherconscionable than in putting on the mere form ofcivil and humane seeming, for the better compassingof his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, afinder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp andcounterfeit advantages, though true advantage neverpresent itself; a devilish knave. Besides, theknave is handsome, young, and hath all thoserequisites in him that folly and green minds lookafter: a pestilent complete knave; and the womanhath found him already.RODERIGOI cannot believe that in her; she's full ofmost blessed condition.IAGOBlessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made ofgrapes: if she had been blessed, she would neverhave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thounot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didstnot mark that?RODERIGOYes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.IAGOLechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologueto the history of lust and foul thoughts. They metso near with their lips that their breaths embracedtogether. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when thesemutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comesthe master and main exercise, the incorporateconclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: Ihave brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knowsyou not. I'll not be far from you: do you findsome occasion to anger Cassio, either by speakingtoo loud, or tainting his discipline; or from whatother course you please, which the time shall morefavourably minister.RODERIGOWell.IAGOSir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haplymay strike at you: provoke him, that he may; foreven out of that will I cause these of Cyprus tomutiny; whose qualification shall come into no truetaste again but by the displanting of Cassio. Soshall you have a shorter journey to your desires bythe means I shall then have to prefer them; and theimpediment most profitably removed, without thewhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.RODERIGOI will do this, if I can bring it to anyopportunity.IAGOI warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.RODERIGOAdieu.ExitIAGOThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,And I dare think he'll prove to DesdemonaA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;Not out of absolute lust, though peradventureI stand accountant for as great a sin,But partly led to diet my revenge,For that I do suspect the lusty MoorHath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereofDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;And nothing can or shall content my soulTill I am even'd with him, wife for wife,Or failing so, yet that I put the MoorAt least into a jealousy so strongThat judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trashFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.For making him egregiously an assAnd practising upon his peace and quietEven to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.ExitSCENE II. A street.Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People followingHeraldIt is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiantgeneral, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,some to make bonfires, each man to what sport andrevels his addiction leads him: for, besides thesebeneficial news, it is the celebration of hisnuptial. So much was his pleasure should beproclaimed. All offices are open, and there is fullliberty of feasting from this present hour of fivetill the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless theisle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!ExeuntSCENE III. A hall in the castle.Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and AttendantsOTHELLOGood Michael, look you to the guard to-night:Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,Not to outsport discretion.CASSIOIago hath direction what to do;But, notwithstanding, with my personal eyeWill I look to't.OTHELLOIago is most honest.Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliestLet me have speech with you.To DESDEMONACome, my dear love,The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.Good night.Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and AttendantsEnter IAGOCASSIOWelcome, Iago; we must to the watch.IAGONot this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' theclock. Our general cast us thus early for the loveof his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; andshe is sport for Jove.CASSIOShe's a most exquisite lady.IAGOAnd, I'll warrant her, fun of game.CASSIOIndeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.IAGOWhat an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley ofprovocation.CASSIOAn inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.IAGOAnd when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?CASSIOShe is indeed perfection.IAGOWell, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, Ihave a stoup of wine; and here without are a braceof Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure tothe health of black Othello.CASSIONot to-night, good Iago: I have very poor andunhappy brains for drinking: I could well wishcourtesy would invent some other custom ofentertainment.IAGOO, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink foryou.CASSIOI have drunk but one cup to-night, and that wascraftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovationit makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,and dare not task my weakness with any more.IAGOWhat, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallantsdesire it.CASSIOWhere are they?IAGOHere at the door; I pray you, call them in.CASSIOI'll do't; but it dislikes me.ExitIAGOIf I can fasten but one cup upon him,With that which he hath drunk to-night already,He'll be as full of quarrel and offenceAs my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,To Desdemona hath to-night carousedPotations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,That hold their honours in a wary distance,The very elements of this warlike isle,Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,Am I to put our Cassio in some actionThat may offend the isle.--But here they come:If consequence do but approve my dream,My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wineCASSIO'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.MONTANOGood faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I ama soldier.IAGOSome wine, ho!SingsAnd let me the canakin clink, clink;And let me the canakin clinkA soldier's a man;A life's but a span;Why, then, let a soldier drink.Some wine, boys!CASSIO'Fore God, an excellent song.IAGOI learned it in England, where, indeed, they aremost potent in potting: your Dane, your German, andyour swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothingto your English.CASSIOIs your Englishman so expert in his drinking?IAGOWhy, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane deaddrunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; hegives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottlecan be filled.CASSIOTo the health of our general!MONTANOI am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.IAGOO sweet England!King Stephen was a worthy peer,His breeches cost him but a crown;He held them sixpence all too dear,With that he call'd the tailor lown.He was a wight of high renown,And thou art but of low degree:'Tis pride that pulls the country down;Then take thine auld cloak about thee.Some wine, ho!CASSIOWhy, this is a more exquisite song than the other.IAGOWill you hear't again?CASSIONo; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place thatdoes those things. Well, God's above all; and therebe souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.IAGOIt's true, good lieutenant.CASSIOFor mine own part,--no offence to the general, norany man of quality,--I hope to be saved.IAGOAnd so do I too, lieutenant.CASSIOAy, but, by your leave, not before me; thelieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let'shave no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgiveus our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is myancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, andspeak well enough.AllExcellent well.CASSIOWhy, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.ExitMONTANOTo the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.IAGOYou see this fellow that is gone before;He is a soldier fit to stand by CaesarAnd give direction: and do but see his vice;'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.I fear the trust Othello puts him in.On some odd time of his infirmity,Will shake this island.MONTANOBut is he often thus?IAGO'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:He'll watch the horologe a double set,If drink rock not his cradle.MONTANOIt were wellThe general were put in mind of it.Perhaps he sees it not; or his good naturePrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,And looks not on his evils: is not this true?Enter RODERIGOIAGO[Aside to him]  How now, Roderigo!I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.Exit RODERIGOMONTANOAnd 'tis great pity that the noble MoorShould hazard such a place as his own secondWith one of an ingraft infirmity:It were an honest action to saySo to the Moor.IAGONot I, for this fair island:I do love Cassio well; and would do muchTo cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?Cry within: 'Help! help!'Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGOCASSIOYou rogue! you rascal!MONTANOWhat's the matter, lieutenant?CASSIOA knave teach me my duty!I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.RODERIGOBeat me!CASSIODost thou prate, rogue?Striking RODERIGOMONTANONay, good lieutenant;Staying himI pray you, sir, hold your hand.CASSIOLet me go, sir,Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.MONTANOCome, come,you're drunk.CASSIODrunk!They fightIAGO[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.Exit RODERIGONay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!Bell ringsWho's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!You will be shamed for ever.Re-enter OTHELLO and AttendantsOTHELLOWhat is the matter here?MONTANO'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.FaintsOTHELLOHold, for your lives!IAGOHold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!OTHELLOWhy, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do thatWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:He that stirs next to carve for his own rageHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isleFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.IAGOI do not know: friends all but now, even now,In quarter, and in terms like bride and groomDevesting them for bed; and then, but now--As if some planet had unwitted men--Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,In opposition bloody. I cannot speakAny beginning to this peevish odds;And would in action glorious I had lostThose legs that brought me to a part of it!OTHELLOHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?CASSIOI pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.OTHELLOWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil;The gravity and stillness of your youthThe world hath noted, and your name is greatIn mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,That you unlace your reputation thusAnd spend your rich opinion for the nameOf a night-brawler? give me answer to it.MONTANOWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--While I spare speech, which something nowoffends me,--Of all that I do know: nor know I aughtBy me that's said or done amiss this night;Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,And to defend ourselves it be a sinWhen violence assails us.OTHELLONow, by heaven,My blood begins my safer guides to rule;And passion, having my best judgment collied,Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,Or do but lift this arm, the best of youShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to knowHow this foul rout began, who set it on;And he that is approved in this offence,Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,To manage private and domestic quarrel,In night, and on the court and guard of safety!'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?MONTANOIf partially affined, or leagued in office,Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,Thou art no soldier.IAGOTouch me not so near:I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouthThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio;Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truthShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.Montano and myself being in speech,There comes a fellow crying out for help:And Cassio following him with determined sword,To execute upon him. Sir, this gentlemanSteps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:Myself the crying fellow did pursue,Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,Outran my purpose; and I return'd the ratherFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,And Cassio high in oath; which till to-nightI ne'er might say before. When I came back--For this was brief--I found them close together,At blow and thrust; even as again they wereWhen you yourself did part them.More of this matter cannot I report:But men are men; the best sometimes forget:Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,As men in rage strike those that wish them best,Yet surely Cassio, I believe, receivedFrom him that fled some strange indignity,Which patience could not pass.OTHELLOI know, Iago,Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love theeBut never more be officer of mine.Re-enter DESDEMONA, attendedLook, if my gentle love be not raised up!I'll make thee an example.DESDEMONAWhat's the matter?OTHELLOAll's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:Lead him off.To MONTANO, who is led offIago, look with care about the town,And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' lifeTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIOIAGOWhat, are you hurt, lieutenant?CASSIOAy, past all surgery.IAGOMarry, heaven forbid!CASSIOReputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lostmy reputation! I have lost the immortal part ofmyself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,Iago, my reputation!IAGOAs I am an honest man, I thought you had receivedsome bodily wound; there is more sense in that thanin reputation. Reputation is an idle and most falseimposition: oft got without merit, and lost withoutdeserving: you have lost no reputation at all,unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!there are ways to recover the general again: youare but now cast in his mood, a punishment more inpolicy than in malice, even so as one would beat hisoffenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sueto him again, and he's yours.CASSIOI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive sogood a commander with so slight, so drunken, and soindiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?and squabble? swagger? swear? and discoursefustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisiblespirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,let us call thee devil!IAGOWhat was he that you followed with your sword? Whathad he done to you?CASSIOI know not.IAGOIs't possible?CASSIOI remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that menshould put an enemy in their mouths to steal awaytheir brains! that we should, with joy, pleasancerevel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!IAGOWhy, but you are now well enough: how came you thusrecovered?CASSIOIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give placeto the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows meanother, to make me frankly despise myself.IAGOCome, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,the place, and the condition of this countrystands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.CASSIOI will ask him for my place again; he shall tell meI am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,such an answer would stop them all. To be now asensible man, by and by a fool, and presently abeast! O strange! Every inordinate cup isunblessed and the ingredient is a devil.IAGOCome, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.CASSIOI have well approved it, sir. I drunk!IAGOYou or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wifeis now the general: may say so in this respect, forthat he hath devoted and given up himself to thecontemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts andgraces: confess yourself freely to her; importuneher help to put you in your place again: she is ofso free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do morethan she is requested: this broken joint betweenyou and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, myfortunes against any lay worth naming, thiscrack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.CASSIOYou advise me well.IAGOI protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.CASSIOI think it freely; and betimes in the morning I willbeseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.IAGOYou are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; Imust to the watch.CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.ExitIAGOAnd what's he then that says I play the villain?When this advice is free I give and honest,Probal to thinking and indeed the courseTo win the Moor again? For 'tis most easyThe inclining Desdemona to subdueIn any honest suit: she's framed as fruitfulAs the free elements. And then for herTo win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,That she may make, unmake, do what she list,Even as her appetite shall play the godWith his weak function. How am I then a villainTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!When devils will the blackest sins put on,They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,As I do now: for whiles this honest foolPlies Desdemona to repair his fortunesAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,That she repeals him for her body's lust;And by how much she strives to do him good,She shall undo her credit with the Moor.So will I turn her virtue into pitch,And out of her own goodness make the netThat shall enmesh them all.Re-enter RODERIGOHow now, Roderigo!RODERIGOI do follow here in the chase, not like a hound thathunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money isalmost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly wellcudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shallhave so much experience for my pains, and so, withno money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.IAGOHow poor are they that have not patience!What wound did ever heal but by degrees?Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;And wit depends on dilatory time.Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:Though other things grow fair against the sun,Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:Nay, get thee gone.Exit RODERIGOTwo things are to be done:My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;I'll set her on;Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,And bring him jump when he may Cassio findSoliciting his wife: ay, that's the wayDull not device by coldness and delay.ExitACT IIISCENE I.

There's a poor pieceof gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attendsthe general's wife be stirring, tell her there'sone Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:wilt thou do this?ClownShe is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, Ishall seem to notify unto her.CASSIODo, good my friend.Exit ClownEnter IAGOIn happy time, Iago.IAGOYou have not been a-bed, then?CASSIOWhy, no; the day had brokeBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,To send in to your wife: my suit to herIs, that she will to virtuous DesdemonaProcure me some access.IAGOI'll send her to you presently;And I'll devise a mean to draw the MoorOut of the way, that your converse and businessMay be more free.CASSIOI humbly thank you for't.Exit IAGOI never knewA Florentine more kind and honest.Enter EMILIAEMILIAGood morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorryFor your displeasure; but all will sure be well.The general and his wife are talking of it;And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdomHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves youAnd needs no other suitor but his likingsTo take the safest occasion by the frontTo bring you in again.CASSIOYet, I beseech you,If you think fit, or that it may be done,Give me advantage of some brief discourseWith Desdemona alone.EMILIAPray you, come in;I will bestow you where you shall have timeTo speak your bosom freely.CASSIOI am much bound to you.ExeuntSCENE II. A room in the castle.Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and GentlemenOTHELLOThese letters give, Iago, to the pilot;And by him do my duties to the senate:That done, I will be walking on the works;Repair there to me.IAGOWell, my good lord, I'll do't.OTHELLOThis fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?GentlemanWe'll wait upon your lordship.ExeuntSCENE III. The garden of the castle.Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIADESDEMONABe thou assured, good Cassio, I will doAll my abilities in thy behalf.EMILIAGood madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,As if the case were his.DESDEMONAO, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,But I will have my lord and you againAs friendly as you were.CASSIOBounteous madam,Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,He's never any thing but your true servant.DESDEMONAI know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:You have known him long; and be you well assuredHe shall in strangeness stand no further offThan in a polite distance.CASSIOAy, but, lady,That policy may either last so long,Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,Or breed itself so out of circumstance,That, I being absent and my place supplied,My general will forget my love and service.DESDEMONADo not doubt that; before Emilia hereI give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform itTo the last article: my lord shall never rest;I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;I'll intermingle every thing he doesWith Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;For thy solicitor shall rather dieThan give thy cause away.EMILIAMadam, here comes my lord.CASSIOMadam, I'll take my leave.DESDEMONAWhy, stay, and hear me speak.CASSIOMadam, not now: I am very ill at ease,Unfit for mine own purposes.DESDEMONAWell, do your discretion.Exit CASSIOEnter OTHELLO and IAGOIAGOHa! I like not that.OTHELLOWhat dost thou say?IAGONothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.OTHELLOWas not that Cassio parted from my wife?IAGOCassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,That he would steal away so guilty-like,Seeing you coming.OTHELLOI do believe 'twas he.DESDEMONAHow now, my lord!I have been talking with a suitor here,A man that languishes in your displeasure.OTHELLOWho is't you mean?DESDEMONAWhy, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,If I have any grace or power to move you,His present reconciliation take;For if he be not one that truly loves you,That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,I have no judgment in an honest face:I prithee, call him back.OTHELLOWent he hence now?DESDEMONAAy, sooth; so humbledThat he hath left part of his grief with me,To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.OTHELLONot now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.DESDEMONABut shall't be shortly?OTHELLOThe sooner, sweet, for you.DESDEMONAShall't be to-night at supper?OTHELLONo, not to-night.DESDEMONATo-morrow dinner, then?OTHELLOI shall not dine at home;I meet the captains at the citadel.DESDEMONAWhy, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:I prithee, name the time, but let it notExceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;And yet his trespass, in our common reason--Save that, they say, the wars must make examplesOut of their best--is not almost a faultTo incur a private cheque. When shall he come?Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,What you would ask me, that I should deny,Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to doTo bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--OTHELLOPrithee, no more: let him come when he will;I will deny thee nothing.DESDEMONAWhy, this is not a boon;'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,Or sue to you to do a peculiar profitTo your own person: nay, when I have a suitWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,It shall be full of poise and difficult weightAnd fearful to be granted.OTHELLOI will deny thee nothing:Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,To leave me but a little to myself.DESDEMONAShall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.OTHELLOFarewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.DESDEMONAEmilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;Whate'er you be, I am obedient.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIAOTHELLOExcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,Chaos is come again.IAGOMy noble lord--OTHELLOWhat dost thou say, Iago?IAGODid Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,Know of your love?OTHELLOHe did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?IAGOBut for a satisfaction of my thought;No further harm.OTHELLOWhy of thy thought, Iago?IAGOI did not think he had been acquainted with her.OTHELLOO, yes; and went between us very oft.IAGOIndeed!OTHELLOIndeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?Is he not honest?IAGOHonest, my lord!OTHELLOHonest! ay, honest.IAGOMy lord, for aught I know.OTHELLOWhat dost thou think?IAGOThink, my lord!OTHELLOThink, my lord!By heaven, he echoes me,As if there were some monster in his thoughtToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?And when I told thee he was of my counselIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'And didst contract and purse thy brow together,As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brainSome horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,Show me thy thought.IAGOMy lord, you know I love you.OTHELLOI think thou dost;And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:For such things in a false disloyal knaveAre tricks of custom, but in a man that's justThey are close delations, working from the heartThat passion cannot rule.IAGOFor Michael Cassio,I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.OTHELLOI think so too.IAGOMen should be what they seem;Or those that be not, would they might seem none!OTHELLOCertain, men should be what they seem.IAGOWhy, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.OTHELLONay, yet there's more in this:I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughtsThe worst of words.IAGOGood my lord, pardon me:Though I am bound to every act of duty,I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;As where's that palace whereinto foul thingsSometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,But some uncleanly apprehensionsKeep leets and law-days and in session sitWith meditations lawful?OTHELLOThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his earA stranger to thy thoughts.IAGOI do beseech you--Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,As, I confess, it is my nature's plagueTo spy into abuses, and oft my jealousyShapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,From one that so imperfectly conceits,Would take no notice, nor build yourself a troubleOut of his scattering and unsure observance.It were not for your quiet nor your good,Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,To let you know my thoughts.OTHELLOWhat dost thou mean?IAGOGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,Is the immediate jewel of their souls:Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:But he that filches from me my good nameRobs me of that which not enriches himAnd makes me poor indeed.OTHELLOBy heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.IAGOYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand;Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.OTHELLOHa!IAGOO, beware, my lord, of jealousy;It is the green-eyed monster which doth mockThe meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in blissWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'erWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!OTHELLOO misery!IAGOPoor and content is rich and rich enough,But riches fineless is as poor as winterTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defendFrom jealousy!OTHELLOWhy, why is this?Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,To follow still the changes of the moonWith fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubtIs once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,When I shall turn the business of my soulTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealousTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:Nor from mine own weak merits will I drawThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;And on the proof, there is no more but this,--Away at once with love or jealousy!IAGOI am glad of it; for now I shall have reasonTo show the love and duty that I bear youWith franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:I would not have your free and noble nature,Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:I know our country disposition well;In Venice they do let heaven see the pranksThey dare not show their husbands; their best conscienceIs not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.OTHELLODost thou say so?IAGOShe did deceive her father, marrying you;And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,She loved them most.OTHELLOAnd so she did.IAGOWhy, go to then;She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;I humbly do beseech you of your pardonFor too much loving you.OTHELLOI am bound to thee for ever.IAGOI see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.OTHELLONot a jot, not a jot.IAGOI' faith, I fear it has.I hope you will consider what is spokeComes from my love. But I do see you're moved:I am to pray you not to strain my speechTo grosser issues nor to larger reachThan to suspicion.OTHELLOI will not.IAGOShould you do so, my lord,My speech should fall into such vile successAs my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--My lord, I see you're moved.OTHELLONo, not much moved:I do not think but Desdemona's honest.IAGOLong live she so! and long live you to think so!OTHELLOAnd yet, how nature erring from itself,--IAGOAy, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--Not to affect many proposed matchesOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,Whereto we see in all things nature tends--Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.But pardon me; I do not in positionDistinctly speak of her; though I may fearHer will, recoiling to her better judgment,May fall to match you with her country formsAnd happily repent.OTHELLOFarewell, farewell:If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:IAGO[Going]  My lord, I take my leave.OTHELLOWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtlessSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.IAGO[Returning]  My lord, I would I might entreatyour honourTo scan this thing no further; leave it to time:Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,For sure, he fills it up with great ability,Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,You shall by that perceive him and his means:Note, if your lady strain his entertainmentWith any strong or vehement importunity;Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,Let me be thought too busy in my fears--As worthy cause I have to fear I am--And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.OTHELLOFear not my government.IAGOI once more take my leave.ExitOTHELLOThis fellow's of exceeding honesty,And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am blackAnd have not those soft parts of conversationThat chamberers have, or for I am declinedInto the vale of years,--yet that's not much--She's gone. I am abused; and my reliefMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,That we can call these delicate creatures ours,And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,Than keep a corner in the thing I loveFor others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;Prerogatived are they less than the base;'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:Even then this forked plague is fated to usWhen we do quicken. Desdemona comes:Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIAIf she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!I'll not believe't.DESDEMONAHow now, my dear Othello!Your dinner, and the generous islandersBy you invited, do attend your presence.OTHELLOI am to blame.DESDEMONAWhy do you speak so faintly?Are you not well?OTHELLOI have a pain upon my forehead here.DESDEMONA'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:Let me but bind it hard, within this hourIt will be well.OTHELLOYour napkin is too little:He puts the handkerchief from him; and it dropsLet it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.DESDEMONAI am very sorry that you are not well.Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONAEMILIAI am glad I have found this napkin:This was her first remembrance from the Moor:My wayward husband hath a hundred timesWoo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,For he conjured her she should ever keep it,That she reserves it evermore about herTo kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,And give't Iago: what he will do with itHeaven knows, not I;I nothing but to please his fantasy.Re-enter IagoIAGOHow now! what do you here alone?EMILIADo not you chide; I have a thing for you.IAGOA thing for me? it is a common thing--EMILIAHa!IAGOTo have a foolish wife.EMILIAO, is that all? What will you give me nowFor the same handkerchief?IAGOWhat handkerchief?EMILIAWhat handkerchief?Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;That which so often you did bid me steal.IAGOHast stol'n it from her?EMILIANo, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.Look, here it is.IAGOA good wench; give it me.EMILIAWhat will you do with 't, that you have beenso earnestTo have me filch it?IAGO[Snatching it]  Why, what's that to you?EMILIAIf it be not for some purpose of import,Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run madWhen she shall lack it.IAGOBe not acknown on 't; I have use for it.Go, leave me.Exit EMILIAI will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,And let him find it. Trifles light as airAre to the jealous confirmations strongAs proofs of holy writ: this may do something.The Moor already changes with my poison:Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,But with a little act upon the blood.Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:Look, where he comes!Re-enter OTHELLONot poppy, nor mandragora,Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleepWhich thou owedst yesterday.OTHELLOHa! ha! false to me?IAGOWhy, how now, general! no more of that.OTHELLOAvaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:I swear 'tis better to be much abusedThan but to know't a little.IAGOHow now, my lord!OTHELLOWhat sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:I slept the next night well, was free and merry;I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.IAGOI am sorry to hear this.OTHELLOI had been happy, if the general camp,Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,So I had nothing known. O, now, for everFarewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,The royal banner, and all quality,Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throatsThe immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!IAGOIs't possible, my lord?OTHELLOVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,Thou hadst been better have been born a dogThan answer my waked wrath!IAGOIs't come to this?OTHELLOMake me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,That the probation bear no hinge nor loopTo hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!IAGOMy noble lord,--OTHELLOIf thou dost slander her and torture me,Never pray more; abandon all remorse;On horror's head horrors accumulate;Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;For nothing canst thou to damnation addGreater than that.IAGOO grace! O heaven forgive me!Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.That livest to make thine honesty a vice!O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,To be direct and honest is not safe.I thank you for this profit; and from henceI'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.OTHELLONay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.IAGOI should be wise, for honesty's a foolAnd loses that it works for.OTHELLOBy the world,I think my wife be honest and think she is not;I think that thou art just and think thou art not.I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as freshAs Dian's visage, is now begrimed and blackAs mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!IAGOI see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:I do repent me that I put it to you.You would be satisfied?OTHELLOWould! nay, I will.IAGOAnd may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--Behold her topp'd?OTHELLODeath and damnation! O!IAGOIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,If ever mortal eyes do see them bolsterMore than their own! What then? how then?What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?It is impossible you should see this,Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as grossAs ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,If imputation and strong circumstances,Which lead directly to the door of truth,Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.OTHELLOGive me a living reason she's disloyal.IAGOI do not like the office:But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;And, being troubled with a raging tooth,I could not sleep.There are a kind of men so loose of soul,That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:One of this kind is Cassio:In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,As if he pluck'd up kisses by the rootsThat grew upon my lips: then laid his legOver my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and thenCried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'OTHELLOO monstrous! monstrous!IAGONay, this was but his dream.OTHELLOBut this denoted a foregone conclusion:'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.IAGOAnd this may help to thicken other proofsThat do demonstrate thinly.OTHELLOI'll tear her all to pieces.IAGONay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchiefSpotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?OTHELLOI gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.IAGOI know not that; but such a handkerchief--I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-daySee Cassio wipe his beard with.OTHELLOIf it be that--IAGOIf it be that, or any that was hers,It speaks against her with the other proofs.OTHELLOO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.'Tis gone.Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throneTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,For 'tis of aspics' tongues!IAGOYet be content.OTHELLOO, blood, blood, blood!IAGOPatience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.OTHELLONever, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,Whose icy current and compulsive courseNe'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due onTo the Propontic and the Hellespont,Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,Till that a capable and wide revengeSwallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,KneelsIn the due reverence of a sacred vowI here engage my words.IAGODo not rise yet.KneelsWitness, you ever-burning lights above,You elements that clip us round about,Witness that here Iago doth give upThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,And to obey shall be in me remorse,What bloody business ever.They riseOTHELLOI greet thy love,Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,And will upon the instant put thee to't:Within these three days let me hear thee sayThat Cassio's not alive.IAGOMy friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:But let her live.OTHELLODamn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,To furnish me with some swift means of deathFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.IAGOI am your own for ever.ExeuntSCENE IV. Before the castle.Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and ClownDESDEMONADo you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?ClownI dare not say he lies any where.DESDEMONAWhy, man?ClownHe's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,is stabbing.DESDEMONAGo to: where lodges he?ClownTo tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.DESDEMONACan any thing be made of this?ClownI know not where he lodges, and for me to devise alodging and say he lies here or he lies there, wereto lie in mine own throat.DESDEMONACan you inquire him out, and be edified by report?ClownI will catechise the world for him; that is, makequestions, and by them answer.DESDEMONASeek him, bid him come hither: tell him I havemoved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.ClownTo do this is within the compass of man's wit: andtherefore I will attempt the doing it.ExitDESDEMONAWhere should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?EMILIAI know not, madam.DESDEMONABelieve me, I had rather have lost my purseFull of crusadoes: and, but my noble MoorIs true of mind and made of no such basenessAs jealous creatures are, it were enoughTo put him to ill thinking.EMILIAIs he not jealous?DESDEMONAWho, he? I think the sun where he was bornDrew all such humours from him.EMILIALook, where he comes.DESDEMONAI will not leave him now till CassioBe call'd to him.Enter OTHELLOHow is't with you, my lordOTHELLOWell, my good lady.AsideO, hardness to dissemble!--How do you, Desdemona?DESDEMONAWell, my good lord.OTHELLOGive me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.DESDEMONAIt yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.OTHELLOThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requiresA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,Much castigation, exercise devout;For here's a young and sweating devil here,That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,A frank one.DESDEMONAYou may, indeed, say so;For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.OTHELLOA liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.DESDEMONAI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.OTHELLOWhat promise, chuck?DESDEMONAI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.OTHELLOI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;Lend me thy handkerchief.DESDEMONAHere, my lord.OTHELLOThat which I gave you.DESDEMONAI have it not about me.OTHELLONot?DESDEMONANo, indeed, my lord.OTHELLOThat is a fault.That handkerchiefDid an Egyptian to my mother give;She was a charmer, and could almost readThe thoughts of people: she told her, whileshe kept it,'Twould make her amiable and subdue my fatherEntirely to her love, but if she lost itOr made gift of it, my father's eyeShould hold her loathed and his spirits should huntAfter new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;Make it a darling like your precious eye;To lose't or give't away were such perditionAs nothing else could match.DESDEMONAIs't possible?OTHELLO'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:A sibyl, that had number'd in the worldThe sun to course two hundred compasses,In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;And it was dyed in mummy which the skilfulConserved of maidens' hearts.DESDEMONAIndeed! is't true?OTHELLOMost veritable; therefore look to't well.DESDEMONAThen would to God that I had never seen't!OTHELLOHa! wherefore?DESDEMONAWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?OTHELLOIs't lost? is't gone? speak, is it outo' the way?DESDEMONAHeaven bless us!OTHELLOSay you?DESDEMONAIt is not lost; but what an if it were?OTHELLOHow!DESDEMONAI say, it is not lost.OTHELLOFetch't, let me see't.DESDEMONAWhy, so I can, sir, but I will not now.This is a trick to put me from my suit:Pray you, let Cassio be received again.OTHELLOFetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.DESDEMONACome, come;You'll never meet a more sufficient man.OTHELLOThe handkerchief!DESDEMONAI pray, talk me of Cassio.OTHELLOThe handkerchief!DESDEMONAA man that all his timeHath founded his good fortunes on your love,Shared dangers with you,--OTHELLOThe handkerchief!DESDEMONAIn sooth, you are to blame.OTHELLOAway!ExitEMILIAIs not this man jealous?DESDEMONAI ne'er saw this before.Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:I am most unhappy in the loss of it.EMILIA'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!Enter CASSIO and IAGOIAGOThere is no other way; 'tis she must do't:And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.DESDEMONAHow now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?CASSIOMadam, my former suit: I do beseech youThat by your virtuous means I may againExist, and be a member of his loveWhom I with all the office of my heartEntirely honour: I would not be delay'd.If my offence be of such mortal kindThat nor my service past, nor present sorrows,Nor purposed merit in futurity,Can ransom me into his love again,But to know so must be my benefit;So shall I clothe me in a forced content,And shut myself up in some other course,To fortune's alms.DESDEMONAAlas, thrice-gentle Cassio!My advocation is not now in tune;My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.So help me every spirit sanctified,As I have spoken for you all my bestAnd stood within the blank of his displeasureFor my free speech! you must awhile be patient:What I can do I will; and more I willThan for myself I dare: let that suffice you.IAGOIs my lord angry?EMILIAHe went hence but now,And certainly in strange unquietness.IAGOCan he be angry? I have seen the cannon,When it hath blown his ranks into the air,And, like the devil, from his very armPuff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?Something of moment then: I will go meet him:There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.DESDEMONAI prithee, do so.Exit IAGOSomething, sure, of state,Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practiseMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such casesMen's natures wrangle with inferior things,Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;For let our finger ache, and it induesOur other healthful members even to that senseOf pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,Nor of them look for such observancesAs fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,And he's indicted falsely.EMILIAPray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,And no conception nor no jealous toyConcerning you.DESDEMONAAlas the day! I never gave him cause.EMILIABut jealous souls will not be answer'd so;They are not ever jealous for the cause,But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monsterBegot upon itself, born on itself.DESDEMONAHeaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!EMILIALady, amen.DESDEMONAI will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:If I do find him fit, I'll move your suitAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.CASSIOI humbly thank your ladyship.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIAEnter BIANCABIANCASave you, friend Cassio!CASSIOWhat make you from home?How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.BIANCAAnd I was going to your lodging, Cassio.What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,More tedious than the dial eight score times?O weary reckoning!CASSIOPardon me, Bianca:I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:But I shall, in a more continuate time,Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchiefTake me this work out.BIANCAO Cassio, whence came this?This is some token from a newer friend:To the felt absence now I feel a cause:Is't come to this? Well, well.CASSIOGo to, woman!Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,From whence you have them. You are jealous nowThat this is from some mistress, some remembrance:No, in good troth, Bianca.BIANCAWhy, whose is it?CASSIOI know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.I like the work well: ere it be demanded--As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.BIANCALeave you! wherefore?CASSIOI do attend here on the general;And think it no addition, nor my wish,To have him see me woman'd.BIANCAWhy, I pray you?CASSIONot that I love you not.BIANCABut that you do not love me.I pray you, bring me on the way a little,And say if I shall see you soon at night.CASSIO'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.BIANCA'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I.

Before the castle.Enter OTHELLO and IAGOIAGOWill you think so?OTHELLOThink so, Iago!IAGOWhat,To kiss in private?OTHELLOAn unauthorized kiss.IAGOOr to be naked with her friend in bedAn hour or more, not meaning any harm?OTHELLONaked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!It is hypocrisy against the devil:They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.IAGOSo they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--OTHELLOWhat then?IAGOWhy, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,She may, I think, bestow't on any man.OTHELLOShe is protectress of her honour too:May she give that?IAGOHer honour is an essence that's not seen;They have it very oft that have it not:But, for the handkerchief,--OTHELLOBy heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,As doth the raven o'er the infected house,Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.IAGOAy, what of that?OTHELLOThat's not so good now.IAGOWhat,If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,Who having, by their own importunate suit,Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,Convinced or supplied them, cannot chooseBut they must blab--OTHELLOHath he said any thing?IAGOHe hath, my lord; but be you well assured,No more than he'll unswear.OTHELLOWhat hath he said?IAGO'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.OTHELLOWhat? what?IAGOLie--OTHELLOWith her?IAGOWith her, on her; what you will.OTHELLOLie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, whenthey belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--Toconfess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to behanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.Nature would not invest herself in such shadowingpassion without some instruction. It is not wordsthat shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--Falls in a tranceIAGOWork on,My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!My lord, I say! Othello!Enter CASSIOHow now, Cassio!CASSIOWhat's the matter?IAGOMy lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.CASSIORub him about the temples.IAGONo, forbear;The lethargy must have his quiet course:If not, he foams at mouth and by and byBreaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:Do you withdraw yourself a little while,He will recover straight: when he is gone,I would on great occasion speak with you.Exit CASSIOHow is it, general? have you not hurt your head?OTHELLODost thou mock me?IAGOI mock you! no, by heaven.Would you would bear your fortune like a man!OTHELLOA horned man's a monster and a beast.IAGOThere's many a beast then in a populous city,And many a civil monster.OTHELLODid he confess it?IAGOGood sir, be a man;Think every bearded fellow that's but yokedMay draw with you: there's millions now aliveThat nightly lie in those unproper bedsWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,To lip a wanton in a secure couch,And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.OTHELLOO, thou art wise; 'tis certain.IAGOStand you awhile apart;Confine yourself but in a patient list.Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--A passion most unsuiting such a man--Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,Bade him anon return and here speak with me;The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,That dwell in every region of his face;For I will make him tell the tale anew,Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and whenHe hath, and is again to cope your wife:I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,And nothing of a man.OTHELLODost thou hear, Iago?I will be found most cunning in my patience;But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.IAGOThat's not amiss;But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?OTHELLO retiresNow will I question Cassio of Bianca,A housewife that by selling her desiresBuys herself bread and clothes: it is a creatureThat dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plagueTo beguile many and be beguiled by one:He, when he hears of her, cannot refrainFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes:Re-enter CASSIOAs he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;And his unbookish jealousy must construePoor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?CASSIOThe worser that you give me the additionWhose want even kills me.IAGOPly Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.Speaking lowerNow, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,How quickly should you speed!CASSIOAlas, poor caitiff!OTHELLOLook, how he laughs already!IAGOI never knew woman love man so.CASSIOAlas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.OTHELLONow he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.IAGODo you hear, Cassio?OTHELLONow he importunes himTo tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.IAGOShe gives it out that you shall marry hey:Do you intend it?CASSIOHa, ha, ha!OTHELLODo you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?CASSIOI marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear somecharity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.Ha, ha, ha!OTHELLOSo, so, so, so: they laugh that win.IAGO'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.CASSIOPrithee, say true.IAGOI am a very villain else.OTHELLOHave you scored me? Well.CASSIOThis is the monkey's own giving out: she ispersuaded I will marry her, out of her own love andflattery, not out of my promise.OTHELLOIago beckons me; now he begins the story.CASSIOShe was here even now; she haunts me in every place.I was the other day talking on the sea-bank withcertain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--OTHELLOCrying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gestureimports it.CASSIOSo hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!OTHELLONow he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shallthrow it to.CASSIOWell, I must leave her company.IAGOBefore me! look, where she comes.CASSIO'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.Enter BIANCAWhat do you mean by this haunting of me?BIANCALet the devil and his dam haunt you! What did youmean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out thework?--A likely piece of work, that you should findit in your chamber, and not know who left it there!This is some minx's token, and I must take out thework? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoeveryou had it, I'll take out no work on't.CASSIOHow now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!OTHELLOBy heaven, that should be my handkerchief!BIANCAAn you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an youwill not, come when you are next prepared for.ExitIAGOAfter her, after her.CASSIO'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.IAGOWill you sup there?CASSIO'Faith, I intend so.IAGOWell, I may chance to see you; for I would very fainspeak with you.CASSIOPrithee, come; will you?IAGOGo to; say no more.Exit CASSIOOTHELLO[Advancing]  How shall I murder him, Iago?IAGODid you perceive how he laughed at his vice?OTHELLOO Iago!IAGOAnd did you see the handkerchief?OTHELLOWas that mine?IAGOYours by this hand: and to see how he prizes thefoolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and hehath given it his whore.OTHELLOI would have him nine years a-killing.A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!IAGONay, you must forget that.OTHELLOAy, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned tostone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, theworld hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie byan emperor's side and command him tasks.IAGONay, that's not your way.OTHELLOHang her! I do but say what she is: so delicatewith her needle: an admirable musician: O! shewill sing the savageness out of a bear: of so highand plenteous wit and invention:--IAGOShe's the worse for all this.OTHELLOO, a thousand thousand times: and then, of sogentle a condition!IAGOAy, too gentle.OTHELLONay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!IAGOIf you are so fond over her iniquity, give herpatent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comesnear nobody.OTHELLOI will chop her into messes: cuckold me!IAGOO, 'tis foul in her.OTHELLOWith mine officer!IAGOThat's fouler.OTHELLOGet me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll notexpostulate with her, lest her body and beautyunprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.IAGODo it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, eventhe bed she hath contaminated.OTHELLOGood, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.IAGOAnd for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: youshall hear more by midnight.OTHELLOExcellent good.A trumpet withinWhat trumpet is that same?IAGOSomething from Venice, sure.

This is a subtle whore,A closet lock and key of villanous secretsAnd yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIADESDEMONAMy lord, what is your will?OTHELLOPray, chuck, come hither.DESDEMONAWhat is your pleasure?OTHELLOLet me see your eyes;Look in my face.DESDEMONAWhat horrible fancy's this?OTHELLO[To EMILIA]  Some of your function, mistress;Leave procreants alone and shut the door;Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.Exit EMILIADESDEMONAUpon my knees, what doth your speech import?I understand a fury in your words.But not the words.OTHELLOWhy, what art thou?DESDEMONAYour wife, my lord; your trueAnd loyal wife.OTHELLOCome, swear it, damn thyselfLest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselvesShould fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:Swear thou art honest.DESDEMONAHeaven doth truly know it.OTHELLOHeaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.DESDEMONATo whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?OTHELLOO Desdemona! away! away! away!DESDEMONAAlas the heavy day! Why do you weep?Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?If haply you my father do suspectAn instrument of this your calling back,Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,Why, I have lost him too.OTHELLOHad it pleased heavenTo try me with affliction; had they rain'dAll kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,I should have found in some place of my soulA drop of patience: but, alas, to make meA fixed figure for the time of scornTo point his slow unmoving finger at!Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,Where either I must live, or bear no life;The fountain from the which my current runs,Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!Or keep it as a cistern for foul toadsTo knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--Ay, there, look grim as hell!DESDEMONAI hope my noble lord esteems me honest.OTHELLOO, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,That quicken even with blowing.

What committed!Committed! O thou public commoner!I should make very forges of my cheeks,That would to cinders burn up modesty,Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,The bawdy wind that kisses all it meetsIs hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,And will not hear it. What committed!Impudent strumpet!DESDEMONABy heaven, you do me wrong.OTHELLOAre you not a strumpet?DESDEMONANo, as I am a Christian:If to preserve this vessel for my lordFrom any other foul unlawful touchBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.OTHELLOWhat, not a whore?DESDEMONANo, as I shall be saved.OTHELLOIs't possible?DESDEMONAO, heaven forgive us!OTHELLOI cry you mercy, then:I took you for that cunning whore of VeniceThat married with Othello.Raising his voiceYou, mistress,That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,And keep the gate of hell!Re-enter EMILIAYou, you, ay, you!We have done our course; there's money for your pains:I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.ExitEMILIAAlas, what does this gentleman conceive?How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?DESDEMONA'Faith, half asleep.EMILIAGood madam, what's the matter with my lord?DESDEMONAWith who?EMILIAWhy, with my lord, madam.DESDEMONAWho is thy lord?EMILIAHe that is yours, sweet lady.DESDEMONAI have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,But what should go by water. Prithee, tonightLay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;And call thy husband hither.EMILIAHere's a change indeed!ExitDESDEMONA'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.How have I been behaved, that he might stickThe small'st opinion on my least misuse?Re-enter EMILIA with IAGOIAGOWhat is your pleasure, madam?How is't with you?DESDEMONAI cannot tell. Those that do teach young babesDo it with gentle means and easy tasks:He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,I am a child to chiding.IAGOWhat's the matter, lady?EMILIAAlas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,As true hearts cannot bear.DESDEMONAAm I that name, Iago?IAGOWhat name, fair lady?DESDEMONASuch as she says my lord did say I was.EMILIAHe call'd her whore: a beggar in his drinkCould not have laid such terms upon his callat.IAGOWhy did he so?DESDEMONAI do not know; I am sure I am none such.IAGODo not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!EMILIAHath she forsook so many noble matches,Her father and her country and her friends,To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?DESDEMONAIt is my wretched fortune.IAGOBeshrew him for't!How comes this trick upon him?DESDEMONANay, heaven doth know.EMILIAI will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,Some busy and insinuating rogue,Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.IAGOFie, there is no such man; it is impossible.DESDEMONAIf any such there be, heaven pardon him!EMILIAA halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,And put in every honest hand a whipTo lash the rascals naked through the worldEven from the east to the west!IAGOSpeak within door.EMILIAO, fie upon them! Some such squire he wasThat turn'd your wit the seamy side without,And made you to suspect me with the Moor.IAGOYou are a fool; go to.DESDEMONAO good Iago,What shall I do to win my lord again?Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,Delighted them in any other form;Or that I do not yet, and ever did.And ever will--though he do shake me offTo beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;And his unkindness may defeat my life,But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'It does abhor me now I speak the word;To do the act that might the addition earnNot the world's mass of vanity could make me.IAGOI pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:The business of the state does him offence,And he does chide with you.DESDEMONAIf 'twere no other--IAGO'Tis but so, I warrant.Trumpets withinHark, how these instruments summon to supper!The messengers of Venice stay the meat;Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIAEnter RODERIGOHow now, Roderigo!RODERIGOI do not find that thou dealest justly with me.IAGOWhat in the contrary?RODERIGOEvery day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from meall conveniency than suppliest me with the leastadvantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endureit, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace whatalready I have foolishly suffered.IAGOWill you hear me, Roderigo?RODERIGO'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words andperformances are no kin together.IAGOYou charge me most unjustly.RODERIGOWith nought but truth. I have wasted myself out ofmy means. The jewels you have had from me todeliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted avotarist: you have told me she hath received themand returned me expectations and comforts of suddenrespect and acquaintance, but I find none.IAGOWell; go to; very well.RODERIGOVery well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tisnot very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and beginto find myself fobbed in it.IAGOVery well.RODERIGOI tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myselfknown to Desdemona: if she will return me myjewels, I will give over my suit and repent myunlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself Iwill seek satisfaction of you.IAGOYou have said now.RODERIGOAy, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.IAGOWhy, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even fromthis instant to build on thee a better opinion thanever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hasttaken against me a most just exception; but yet, Iprotest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.RODERIGOIt hath not appeared.IAGOI grant indeed it hath not appeared, and yoursuspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which Ihave greater reason to believe now than ever, I meanpurpose, courage and valour, this night show it: ifthou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,take me from this world with treachery and deviseengines for my life.RODERIGOWell, what is it? is it within reason and compass?IAGOSir, there is especial commission come from Veniceto depute Cassio in Othello's place.RODERIGOIs that true? why, then Othello and Desdemonareturn again to Venice.IAGOO, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away withhim the fair Desdemona, unless his abode belingered here by some accident: wherein none can beso determinate as the removing of Cassio.RODERIGOHow do you mean, removing of him?IAGOWhy, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;knocking out his brains.RODERIGOAnd that you would have me to do?IAGOAy, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will Igo to him: he knows not yet of his horrorablefortune. If you will watch his going thence, whichI will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,you may take him at your pleasure: I will be nearto second your attempt, and he shall fall betweenus. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along withme; I will show you such a necessity in his deaththat you shall think yourself bound to put it onhim. It is now high suppertime, and the night growsto waste: about it.RODERIGOI will hear further reason for this.IAGOAnd you shall be satisfied.ExeuntSCENE III.

Good faith, how foolish are our minds!If I do die before thee prithee, shroud meIn one of those same sheets.EMILIACome, come you talk.DESDEMONAMy mother had a maid call'd Barbara:She was in love, and he she loved proved madAnd did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,And she died singing it: that song to-nightWill not go from my mind; I have much to do,But to go hang my head all at one side,And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.EMILIAShall I go fetch your night-gown?DESDEMONANo, unpin me here.This Lodovico is a proper man.EMILIAA very handsome man.DESDEMONAHe speaks well.EMILIAI know a lady in Venice would have walked barefootto Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.DESDEMONA[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,Sing all a green willow:Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,Sing willow, willow, willow:The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;Sing willow, willow, willow;Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;Lay by these:--SingingSing willow, willow, willow;Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--SingingSing all a green willow must be my garland.Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?EMILIAIt's the wind.DESDEMONA[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but whatsaid he then?Sing willow, willow, willow:If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;Doth that bode weeping?EMILIA'Tis neither here nor there.DESDEMONAI have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--That there be women do abuse their husbandsIn such gross kind?EMILIAThere be some such, no question.DESDEMONAWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?EMILIAWhy, would not you?DESDEMONANo, by this heavenly light!EMILIANor I neither by this heavenly light;I might do't as well i' the dark.DESDEMONAWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?EMILIAThe world's a huge thing: it is a great price.For a small vice.DESDEMONAIn troth, I think thou wouldst not.EMILIAIn troth, I think I should; and undo't when I haddone. Marry, I would not do such a thing for ajoint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor forgowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any pettyexhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who wouldnot make her husband a cuckold to make him amonarch? I should venture purgatory for't.DESDEMONABeshrew me, if I would do such a wrongFor the whole world.EMILIAWhy the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: andhaving the world for your labour, tis a wrong in yourown world, and you might quickly make it right.DESDEMONAI do not think there is any such woman.EMILIAYes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as wouldstore the world they played for.But I do think it is their husbands' faultsIf wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,And pour our treasures into foreign laps,Or else break out in peevish jealousies,Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,Or scant our former having in despite;Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands knowTheir wives have sense like them: they see and smellAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,As husbands have. What is it that they doWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?I think it is: and doth affection breed it?I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?It is so too: and have not we affections,Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?Then let them use us well: else let them know,The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.DESDEMONAGood night, good night: heaven me such uses send,Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!ExeuntACT VSCENE I.

'tis not so now.Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;Man but a rush against Othello's breast,And he retires. Where should Othello go?Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!Even like thy chastity.

For this slave,If there be any cunning crueltyThat can torment him much and hold him long,It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,Till that the nature of your fault be knownTo the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.OTHELLOSoft you; a word or two before you go.I have done the state some service, and they know't.No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speakOf one that loved not wisely but too well;Of one not easily jealous, but being wroughtPerplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,Like the base Indian, threw a pearl awayRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,Albeit unused to the melting mood,Drop tears as fast as the Arabian treesTheir medicinal gum. Set you down this;And say besides, that in Aleppo once,Where a malignant and a turban'd TurkBeat a Venetian and traduced the state,I took by the throat the circumcised dog,And smote him, thus.Stabs himselfLODOVICOO bloody period!GRATIANOAll that's spoke is marr'd.OTHELLOI kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.Falls on the bed, and diesCASSIOThis did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;For he was great of heart.LODOVICO[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog,More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!Look on the tragic loading of this bed;This is thy work: the object poisons sight;Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,Remains the censure of this hellish villain;The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!Myself will straight aboard: and to the stateThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.Exeunt
