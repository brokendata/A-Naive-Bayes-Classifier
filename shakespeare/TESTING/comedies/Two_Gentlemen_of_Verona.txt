ACT ISCENE I. Verona. An open place.Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUSVALENTINECease to persuade, my loving Proteus:Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.Were't not affection chains thy tender daysTo the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,I rather would entreat thy companyTo see the wonders of the world abroad,Than, living dully sluggardized at home,Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,Even as I would when I to love begin.PROTEUSWilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seestSome rare note-worthy object in thy travel:Wish me partaker in thy happinessWhen thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,If ever danger do environ thee,Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.VALENTINEAnd on a love-book pray for my success?PROTEUSUpon some book I love I'll pray for thee.VALENTINEThat's on some shallow story of deep love:How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.PROTEUSThat's a deep story of a deeper love:For he was more than over shoes in love.VALENTINE'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,And yet you never swum the Hellespont.PROTEUSOver the boots? nay, give me not the boots.VALENTINENo, I will not, for it boots thee not.PROTEUSWhat?VALENTINETo be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirthWith twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;If lost, why then a grievous labour won;However, but a folly bought with wit,Or else a wit by folly vanquished.PROTEUSSo, by your circumstance, you call me fool.VALENTINESo, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.PROTEUS'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.VALENTINELove is your master, for he masters you:And he that is so yoked by a fool,Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.PROTEUSYet writers say, as in the sweetest budThe eating canker dwells, so eating loveInhabits in the finest wits of all.VALENTINEAnd writers say, as the most forward budIs eaten by the canker ere it blow,Even so by love the young and tender witIs turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,Losing his verdure even in the primeAnd all the fair effects of future hopes.But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,That art a votary to fond desire?Once more adieu! my father at the roadExpects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.PROTEUSAnd thither will I bring thee, Valentine.VALENTINESweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.To Milan let me hear from thee by lettersOf thy success in love, and what news elseBetideth here in absence of thy friend;And likewise will visit thee with mine.PROTEUSAll happiness bechance to thee in Milan!VALENTINEAs much to you at home! and so, farewell.ExitPROTEUSHe after honour hunts, I after love:He leaves his friends to dignify them more,I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,War with good counsel, set the world at nought;Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.Enter SPEEDSPEEDSir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?PROTEUSBut now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.SPEEDTwenty to one then he is shipp'd already,And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.PROTEUSIndeed, a sheep doth very often stray,An if the shepherd be a while away.SPEEDYou conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,and I a sheep?PROTEUSI do.SPEEDWhy then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.PROTEUSA silly answer and fitting well a sheep.SPEEDThis proves me still a sheep.PROTEUSTrue; and thy master a shepherd.SPEEDNay, that I can deny by a circumstance.PROTEUSIt shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.SPEEDThe shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep theshepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeksnot me: therefore I am no sheep.PROTEUSThe sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; theshepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou forwages followest thy master; thy master for wagesfollows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.SPEEDSuch another proof will make me cry 'baa.'PROTEUSBut, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?SPEEDAy sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, alost mutton, nothing for my labour.PROTEUSHere's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.SPEEDIf the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.PROTEUSNay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.SPEEDNay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me forcarrying your letter.PROTEUSYou mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.SPEEDFrom a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter toyour lover.PROTEUSBut what said she?SPEED[First nodding]  Ay.PROTEUSNod--Ay--why, that's noddy.SPEEDYou mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you askme if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'PROTEUSAnd that set together is noddy.SPEEDNow you have taken the pains to set it together,take it for your pains.PROTEUSNo, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.SPEEDWell, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.PROTEUSWhy sir, how do you bear with me?SPEEDMarry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothingbut the word 'noddy' for my pains.PROTEUSBeshrew me, but you have a quick wit.SPEEDAnd yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.PROTEUSCome come, open the matter in brief: what said she?SPEEDOpen your purse, that the money and the matter maybe both at once delivered.PROTEUSWell, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?SPEEDTruly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.PROTEUSWhy, couldst thou perceive so much from her?SPEEDSir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:and being so hard to me that brought your mind, Ifear she'll prove as hard to you in telling yourmind. Give her no token but stones; for she's ashard as steel.PROTEUSWhat said she? nothing?SPEEDNo, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' Totestify your bounty, I thank you, you have testernedme; in requital whereof, henceforth carry yourletters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.PROTEUSGo, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,Which cannot perish having thee aboard,Being destined to a drier death on shore.Exit SPEEDI must go send some better messenger:I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,Receiving them from such a worthless post.ExitSCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.Enter JULlA and LUCETTAJULIABut say, Lucetta, now we are alone,Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?LUCETTAAy, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.JULIAOf all the fair resort of gentlemenThat every day with parle encounter me,In thy opinion which is worthiest love?LUCETTAPlease you repeat their names, I'll show my mindAccording to my shallow simple skill.JULIAWhat think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?LUCETTAAs of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;But, were I you, he never should be mine.JULIAWhat think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?LUCETTAWell of his wealth; but of himself, so so.JULIAWhat think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?LUCETTALord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!JULIAHow now! what means this passion at his name?LUCETTAPardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shameThat I, unworthy body as I am,Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.JULIAWhy not on Proteus, as of all the rest?LUCETTAThen thus: of many good I think him best.JULIAYour reason?LUCETTAI have no other, but a woman's reason;I think him so because I think him so.JULIAAnd wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?LUCETTAAy, if you thought your love not cast away.JULIAWhy he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.LUCETTAYet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.JULIAHis little speaking shows his love but small.LUCETTAFire that's closest kept burns most of all.JULIAThey do not love that do not show their love.LUCETTAO, they love least that let men know their love.JULIAI would I knew his mind.LUCETTAPeruse this paper, madam.JULIA'To Julia.' Say, from whom?LUCETTAThat the contents will show.JULIASay, say, who gave it thee?LUCETTAValentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,Did in your name receive it: pardon thefault I pray.JULIANow, by my modesty, a goodly broker!Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?To whisper and conspire against my youth?Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worthAnd you an officer fit for the place.Or else return no more into my sight.LUCETTATo plead for love deserves more fee than hate.JULIAWill ye be gone?LUCETTAThat you may ruminate.ExitJULIAAnd yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:It were a shame to call her back againAnd pray her to a fault for which I chid her.What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,And would not force the letter to my view!Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to thatWhich they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish loveThat, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurseAnd presently all humbled kiss the rod!How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,When willingly I would have had her here!How angerly I taught my brow to frown,When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!My penance is to call Lucetta backAnd ask remission for my folly past.What ho! Lucetta!Re-enter LUCETTALUCETTAWhat would your ladyship?JULIAIs't near dinner-time?LUCETTAI would it were,That you might kill your stomach on your meatAnd not upon your maid.JULIAWhat is't that you took up so gingerly?LUCETTANothing.JULIAWhy didst thou stoop, then?LUCETTATo take a paper up that I let fall.JULIAAnd is that paper nothing?LUCETTANothing concerning me.JULIAThen let it lie for those that it concerns.LUCETTAMadam, it will not lie where it concernsUnless it have a false interpeter.JULIASome love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.LUCETTAThat I might sing it, madam, to a tune.Give me a note: your ladyship can set.JULIAAs little by such toys as may be possible.Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'LUCETTAIt is too heavy for so light a tune.JULIAHeavy! belike it hath some burden then?LUCETTAAy, and melodious were it, would you sing it.JULIAAnd why not you?LUCETTAI cannot reach so high.JULIALet's see your song. How now, minion!LUCETTAKeep tune there still, so you will sing it out:And yet methinks I do not like this tune.JULIAYou do not?LUCETTANo, madam; it is too sharp.JULIAYou, minion, are too saucy.LUCETTANay, now you are too flatAnd mar the concord with too harsh a descant:There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.JULIAThe mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.LUCETTAIndeed, I bid the base for Proteus.JULIAThis babble shall not henceforth trouble me.Here is a coil with protestation!Tears the letterGo get you gone, and let the papers lie:You would be fingering them, to anger me.LUCETTAShe makes it strange; but she would be best pleasedTo be so anger'd with another letter.ExitJULIANay, would I were so anger'd with the same!O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honeyAnd kill the bees that yield it with your stings!I'll kiss each several paper for amends.Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!As in revenge of thy ingratitude,I throw thy name against the bruising stones,Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bedShall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.Be calm, good wind, blow not a word awayTill I have found each letter in the letter,Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bearUnto a ragged fearful-hanging rockAnd throw it thence into the raging sea!Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.And yet I will not, sith so prettilyHe couples it to his complaining names.Thus will I fold them one on another:Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.Re-enter LUCETTALUCETTAMadam,Dinner is ready, and your father stays.JULIAWell, let us go.LUCETTAWhat, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?JULIAIf you respect them, best to take them up.LUCETTANay, I was taken up for laying them down:Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.JULIAI see you have a month's mind to them.LUCETTAAy, madam, you may say what sights you see;I see things too, although you judge I wink.JULIACome, come; will't please you go?ExeuntSCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINOANTONIOTell me, Panthino, what sad talk was thatWherewith my brother held you in the cloister?PANTHINO'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.ANTONIOWhy, what of him?PANTHINOHe wonder'd that your lordshipWould suffer him to spend his youth at home,While other men, of slender reputation,Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;Some to discover islands far away;Some to the studious universities.For any or for all these exercises,He said that Proteus your son was meet,And did request me to importune youTo let him spend his time no more at home,Which would be great impeachment to his age,In having known no travel in his youth.ANTONIONor need'st thou much importune me to thatWhereon this month I have been hammering.I have consider'd well his loss of timeAnd how he cannot be a perfect man,Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:Experience is by industry achievedAnd perfected by the swift course of time.Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?PANTHINOI think your lordship is not ignorantHow his companion, youthful Valentine,Attends the emperor in his royal court.ANTONIOI know it well.PANTHINO'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.And be in eye of every exerciseWorthy his youth and nobleness of birth.ANTONIOI like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,The execution of it shall make known.Even with the speediest expeditionI will dispatch him to the emperor's court.PANTHINOTo-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,With other gentlemen of good esteem,Are journeying to salute the emperorAnd to commend their service to his will.ANTONIOGood company; with them shall Proteus go:And, in good time! now will we break with him.Enter PROTEUSPROTEUSSweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,To seal our happiness with their consents!O heavenly Julia!ANTONIOHow now! what letter are you reading there?PROTEUSMay't please your lordship, 'tis a word or twoOf commendations sent from Valentine,Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.ANTONIOLend me the letter; let me see what news.PROTEUSThere is no news, my lord, but that he writesHow happily he lives, how well belovedAnd daily graced by the emperor;Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.ANTONIOAnd how stand you affected to his wish?PROTEUSAs one relying on your lordship's willAnd not depending on his friendly wish.ANTONIOMy will is something sorted with his wish.Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;For what I will, I will, and there an end.I am resolved that thou shalt spend some timeWith Valentinus in the emperor's court:What maintenance he from his friends receives,Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.To-morrow be in readiness to go:Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.PROTEUSMy lord, I cannot be so soon provided:Please you, deliberate a day or two.ANTONIOLook, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'dTo hasten on his expedition.Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINOPROTEUSThus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,Lest he should take exceptions to my love;And with the vantage of mine own excuseHath he excepted most against my love.O, how this spring of love resemblethThe uncertain glory of an April day,Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,And by and by a cloud takes all away!Re-enter PANTHINOPANTHINOSir Proteus, your father calls for you:He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.PROTEUSWhy, this it is: my heart accords thereto,And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'ExeuntACT IISCENE I.

Madam Silvia!VALENTINEHow now, sirrah?SPEEDShe is not within hearing, sir.VALENTINEWhy, sir, who bade you call her?SPEEDYour worship, sir; or else I mistook.VALENTINEWell, you'll still be too forward.SPEEDAnd yet I was last chidden for being too slow.VALENTINEGo to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?SPEEDShe that your worship loves?VALENTINEWhy, how know you that I am in love?SPEEDMarry, by these special marks: first, you havelearned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like arobin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that hadthe pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that hadlost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that hadburied her grandam; to fast, like one that takesdiet; to watch like one that fears robbing; tospeak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You werewont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when youwalked, to walk like one of the lions; when youfasted, it was presently after dinner; when youlooked sadly, it was for want of money: and now youare metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I lookon you, I can hardly think you my master.VALENTINEAre all these things perceived in me?SPEEDThey are all perceived without ye.VALENTINEWithout me? they cannot.SPEEDWithout you? nay, that's certain, for, without youwere so simple, none else would: but you are sowithout these follies, that these follies are withinyou and shine through you like the water in anurinal, that not an eye that sees you but is aphysician to comment on your malady.VALENTINEBut tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?SPEEDShe that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?VALENTINEHast thou observed that? even she, I mean.SPEEDWhy, sir, I know her not.VALENTINEDost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yetknowest her not?SPEEDIs she not hard-favoured, sir?VALENTINENot so fair, boy, as well-favoured.SPEEDSir, I know that well enough.VALENTINEWhat dost thou know?SPEEDThat she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.VALENTINEI mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.SPEEDThat's because the one is painted and the other outof all count.VALENTINEHow painted? and how out of count?SPEEDMarry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that noman counts of her beauty.VALENTINEHow esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.SPEEDYou never saw her since she was deformed.VALENTINEHow long hath she been deformed?SPEEDEver since you loved her.VALENTINEI have loved her ever since I saw her; and still Isee her beautiful.SPEEDIf you love her, you cannot see her.VALENTINEWhy?SPEEDBecause Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;or your own eyes had the lights they were wont tohave when you chid at Sir Proteus for goingungartered!VALENTINEWhat should I see then?SPEEDYour own present folly and her passing deformity:for he, being in love, could not see to garter hishose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.VALENTINEBelike, boy, then, you are in love; for lastmorning you could not see to wipe my shoes.SPEEDTrue, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,you swinged me for my love, which makes me thebolder to chide you for yours.VALENTINEIn conclusion, I stand affected to her.SPEEDI would you were set, so your affection would cease.VALENTINELast night she enjoined me to write some lines toone she loves.SPEEDAnd have you?VALENTINEI have.SPEEDAre they not lamely writ?VALENTINENo, boy, but as well as I can do them.

O exceeding puppet!Now will he interpret to her.Enter SILVIAVALENTINEMadam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.SPEED[Aside]  O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.SILVIASir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.SPEED[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.VALENTINEAs you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letterUnto the secret nameless friend of yours;Which I was much unwilling to proceed inBut for my duty to your ladyship.SILVIAI thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.VALENTINENow trust me, madam, it came hardly off;For being ignorant to whom it goesI writ at random, very doubtfully.SILVIAPerchance you think too much of so much pains?VALENTINENo, madam; so it stead you, I will writePlease you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--SILVIAA pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.SPEED[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'VALENTINEWhat means your ladyship? do you not like it?SILVIAYes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;But since unwillingly, take them again.Nay, take them.VALENTINEMadam, they are for you.SILVIAAy, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;But I will none of them; they are for you;I would have had them writ more movingly.VALENTINEPlease you, I'll write your ladyship another.SILVIAAnd when it's writ, for my sake read it over,And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.VALENTINEIf it please me, madam, what then?SILVIAWhy, if it please you, take it for your labour:And so, good morrow, servant.ExitSPEEDO jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!My master sues to her, and she hathtaught her suitor,He being her pupil, to become her tutor.O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,That my master, being scribe, to himself should writethe letter?VALENTINEHow now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?SPEEDNay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.VALENTINETo do what?SPEEDTo be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.VALENTINETo whom?SPEEDTo yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.VALENTINEWhat figure?SPEEDBy a letter, I should say.VALENTINEWhy, she hath not writ to me?SPEEDWhat need she, when she hath made you write toyourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?VALENTINENo, believe me.SPEEDNo believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceiveher earnest?VALENTINEShe gave me none, except an angry word.SPEEDWhy, she hath given you a letter.VALENTINEThat's the letter I writ to her friend.SPEEDAnd that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.VALENTINEI would it were no worse.SPEEDI'll warrant you, 'tis as well:For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.VALENTINEI have dined.SPEEDAy, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love canfeed on the air, I am one that am nourished by myvictuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not likeyour mistress; be moved, be moved.ExeuntSCENE II. Verona.

SirThurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.THURIOSir, if you spend word for word with me, I shallmake your wit bankrupt.VALENTINEI know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,and, I think, no other treasure to give yourfollowers, for it appears by their bare liveries,that they live by your bare words.SILVIANo more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.Enter DUKEDUKENow, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:What say you to a letter from your friendsOf much good news?VALENTINEMy lord, I will be thankful.To any happy messenger from thence.DUKEKnow ye Don Antonio, your countryman?VALENTINEAy, my good lord, I know the gentlemanTo be of worth and worthy estimationAnd not without desert so well reputed.DUKEHath he not a son?VALENTINEAy, my good lord; a son that well deservesThe honour and regard of such a father.DUKEYou know him well?VALENTINEI know him as myself; for from our infancyWe have conversed and spent our hours together:And though myself have been an idle truant,Omitting the sweet benefit of timeTo clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,Made use and fair advantage of his days;His years but young, but his experience old;His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;And, in a word, for far behind his worthComes all the praises that I now bestow,He is complete in feature and in mindWith all good grace to grace a gentleman.DUKEBeshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,He is as worthy for an empress' loveAs meet to be an emperor's counsellor.Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,With commendation from great potentates;And here he means to spend his time awhile:I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.VALENTINEShould I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.DUKEWelcome him then according to his worth.Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:I will send him hither to you presently.ExitVALENTINEThis is the gentleman I told your ladyshipHad come along with me, but that his mistressDid hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.SILVIABelike that now she hath enfranchised themUpon some other pawn for fealty.VALENTINENay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.SILVIANay, then he should be blind; and, being blindHow could he see his way to seek out you?VALENTINEWhy, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.THURIOThey say that Love hath not an eye at all.VALENTINETo see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:Upon a homely object Love can wink.SILVIAHave done, have done; here comes the gentleman.Exit THURIOEnter PROTEUSVALENTINEWelcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,Confirm his welcome with some special favour.SILVIAHis worth is warrant for his welcome hither,If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.VALENTINEMistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain himTo be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.SILVIAToo low a mistress for so high a servant.PROTEUSNot so, sweet  lady: but too mean a servantTo have a look of such a worthy mistress.VALENTINELeave off discourse of disability:Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.PROTEUSMy duty will I boast of; nothing else.SILVIAAnd duty never yet did want his meed:Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.PROTEUSI'll die on him that says so but yourself.SILVIAThat you are welcome?PROTEUSThat you are worthless.Re-enter THURIOTHURIOMadam, my lord your father would speak with you.SILVIAI wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;When you have done, we look to hear from you.PROTEUSWe'll both attend upon your ladyship.Exeunt SILVIA and THURIOVALENTINENow, tell me, how do all from whence you came?PROTEUSYour friends are well and have them much commended.VALENTINEAnd how do yours?PROTEUSI left them all in health.VALENTINEHow does your lady? and how thrives your love?PROTEUSMy tales of love were wont to weary you;I know you joy not in a love discourse.VALENTINEAy, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:I have done penance for contemning Love,Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd meWith bitter fasts, with penitential groans,With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;For in revenge of my contempt of love,Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyesAnd made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,There is no woe to his correction,Nor to his service no such joy on earth.Now no discourse, except it be of love;Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,Upon the very naked name of love.PROTEUSEnough; I read your fortune in your eye.Was this the idol that you worship so?VALENTINEEven she; and is she not a heavenly saint?PROTEUSNo; but she is an earthly paragon.VALENTINECall her divine.PROTEUSI will not flatter her.VALENTINEO, flatter me; for love delights in praises.PROTEUSWhen I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,And I must minister the like to you.VALENTINEThen speak the truth by her; if not divine,Yet let her be a principality,Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.PROTEUSExcept my mistress.VALENTINESweet, except not any;Except thou wilt except against my love.PROTEUSHave I not reason to prefer mine own?VALENTINEAnd I will help thee to prefer her too:She shall be dignified with this high honour--To bear my lady's train, lest the base earthShould from her vesture chance to steal a kissAnd, of so great a favour growing proud,Disdain to root the summer-swelling flowerAnd make rough winter everlastingly.PROTEUSWhy, Valentine, what braggardism is this?VALENTINEPardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothingTo her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;She is alone.PROTEUSThen let her alone.VALENTINENot for the world: why, man, she is mine own,And I as rich in having such a jewelAs twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.My foolish rival, that her father likesOnly for his possessions are so huge,Is gone with her along, and I must after,For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.PROTEUSBut she loves you?VALENTINEAy, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,marriage-hour,With all the cunning manner of our flight,Determined of; how I must climb her window,The ladder made of cords, and all the meansPlotted and 'greed on for my happiness.Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.PROTEUSGo on before; I shall inquire you forth:I must unto the road, to disembarkSome necessaries that I needs must use,And then I'll presently attend you.VALENTINEWill you make haste?PROTEUSI will.Exit VALENTINEEven as one heat another heat expels,Or as one nail by strength drives out another,So the remembrance of my former loveIs by a newer object quite forgotten.Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,Her true perfection, or my false transgression,That makes me reasonless to reason thus?She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,Bears no impression of the thing it was.Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,And that I love him not as I was wont.O, but I love his lady too too much,And that's the reason I love him so little.How shall I dote on her with more advice,That thus without advice begin to love her!'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,And that hath dazzled my reason's light;But when I look on her perfections,There is no reason but I shall be blind.If I can cheque my erring love, I will;If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.ExitSCENE V. The same. A street.Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severallySPEEDLaunce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!LAUNCEForswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am notwelcome. I reckon this always, that a man is neverundone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to aplace till some certain shot be paid and the hostesssay 'Welcome!'SPEEDCome on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with youpresently; where, for one shot of five pence, thoushalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, howdid thy master part with Madam Julia?LAUNCEMarry, after they closed in earnest, they parted veryfairly in jest.SPEEDBut shall she marry him?LAUNCENo.SPEEDHow then? shall he marry her?LAUNCENo, neither.SPEEDWhat, are they broken?LAUNCENo, they are both as whole as a fish.SPEEDWhy, then, how stands the matter with them?LAUNCEMarry, thus: when it stands well with him, itstands well with her.SPEEDWhat an ass art thou! I understand thee not.LAUNCEWhat a block art thou, that thou canst not!

But, Launce, how sayestthou, that my master is become a notable lover?LAUNCEI never knew him otherwise.SPEEDThan how?LAUNCEA notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.SPEEDWhy, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.LAUNCEWhy, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.SPEEDI tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.LAUNCEWhy, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himselfin love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth thename of a Christian.SPEEDWhy?LAUNCEBecause thou hast not so much charity in thee as togo to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?SPEEDAt thy service.ExeuntSCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.Enter PROTEUSPROTEUSTo leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;And even that power which gave me first my oathProvokes me to this threefold perjury;Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!At first I did adore a twinkling star,But now I worship a celestial sun.Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,And he wants wit that wants resolved willTo learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'dWith twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;But there I leave to love where I should love.Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;If I lose them, thus find I by their lossFor Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.I to myself am dearer than a friend,For love is still most precious in itself;And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.I will forget that Julia is alive,Remembering that my love to her is dead;And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.I cannot now prove constant to myself,Without some treachery used to Valentine.This night he meaneth with a corded ladderTo climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,Myself in counsel, his competitor.Now presently I'll give her father noticeOf their disguising and pretended flight;Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly crossBy some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!ExitSCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.Enter JULIA and LUCETTAJULIACounsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;And even in kind love I do conjure thee,Who art the table wherein all my thoughtsAre visibly character'd and engraved,To lesson me and tell me some good meanHow, with my honour, I may undertakeA journey to my loving Proteus.LUCETTAAlas, the way is wearisome and long!JULIAA true-devoted pilgrim is not wearyTo measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,And when the flight is made to one so dear,Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.LUCETTABetter forbear till Proteus make return.JULIAO, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?Pity the dearth that I have pined in,By longing for that food so long a time.Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snowAs seek to quench the fire of love with words.LUCETTAI do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,But qualify the fire's extreme rage,Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.JULIAThe more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.The current that with gentle murmur glides,Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;But when his fair course is not hindered,He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,Giving a gentle kiss to every sedgeHe overtaketh in his pilgrimage,And so by many winding nooks he straysWith willing sport to the wild ocean.Then let me go and hinder not my courseI'll be as patient as a gentle streamAnd make a pastime of each weary step,Till the last step have brought me to my love;And there I'll rest, as after much turmoilA blessed soul doth in Elysium.LUCETTABut in what habit will you go along?JULIANot like a woman; for I would preventThe loose encounters of lascivious men:Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weedsAs may beseem some well-reputed page.LUCETTAWhy, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.JULIANo, girl, I'll knit it up in silken stringsWith twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.To be fantastic may become a youthOf greater time than I shall show to be.LUCETTAWhat fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?JULIAThat fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,What compass will you wear your farthingale?'Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.LUCETTAYou must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.JULIAOut, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.LUCETTAA round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.JULIALucetta, as thou lovest me, let me haveWhat thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.But tell me, wench, how will the world repute meFor undertaking so unstaid a journey?I fear me, it will make me scandalized.LUCETTAIf you think so, then stay at home and go not.JULIANay, that I will not.LUCETTAThen never dream on infamy, but go.If Proteus like your journey when you come,No matter who's displeased when you are gone:I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.JULIAThat is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tearsAnd instances of infinite of loveWarrant me welcome to my Proteus.LUCETTAAll these are servants to deceitful men.JULIABase men, that use them to so base effect!But truer stars did govern Proteus' birthHis words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.LUCETTAPray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!JULIANow, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrongTo bear a hard opinion of his truth:Only deserve my love by loving him;And presently go with me to my chamber,To take a note of what I stand in need of,To furnish me upon my longing journey.All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,My goods, my lands, my reputation;Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.Come, answer not, but to it presently!I am impatient of my tarriance.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUSDUKESir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;We have some secrets to confer about.Exit THURIONow, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?PROTEUSMy gracious lord, that which I would discoverThe law of friendship bids me to conceal;But when I call to mind your gracious favoursDone to me, undeserving as I am,My duty pricks me on to utter thatWhich else no worldly good should draw from me.Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,This night intends to steal away your daughter:Myself am one made privy to the plot.I know you have determined to bestow herOn Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;And should she thus be stol'n away from you,It would be much vexation to your age.Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather choseTo cross my friend in his intended driftThan, by concealing it, heap on your headA pack of sorrows which would press you down,Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.DUKEProteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;Which to requite, command me while I live.This love of theirs myself have often seen,Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,And oftentimes have purposed to forbidSir Valentine her company and my court:But fearing lest my jealous aim might errAnd so unworthily disgrace the man,A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,I gave him gentle looks, thereby to findThat which thyself hast now disclosed to me.And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,The key whereof myself have ever kept;And thence she cannot be convey'd away.PROTEUSKnow, noble lord, they have devised a meanHow he her chamber-window will ascendAnd with a corded ladder fetch her down;For which the youthful lover now is goneAnd this way comes he with it presently;Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.But, good my Lord, do it so cunninglyThat my discovery be not aimed at;For love of you, not hate unto my friend,Hath made me publisher of this pretence.DUKEUpon mine honour, he shall never knowThat I had any light from thee of this.PROTEUSAdieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.ExitEnter VALENTINEDUKESir Valentine, whither away so fast?VALENTINEPlease it your grace, there is a messengerThat stays to bear my letters to my friends,And I am going to deliver them.DUKEBe they of much import?VALENTINEThe tenor of them doth but signifyMy health and happy being at your court.DUKENay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;I am to break with thee of some affairsThat touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.'Tis not unknown to thee that I have soughtTo match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.VALENTINEI know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the matchWere rich and honourable; besides, the gentlemanIs full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualitiesBeseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?DUKENo, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,Neither regarding that she is my childNor fearing me as if I were her father;And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;And, where I thought the remnant of mine ageShould have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,I now am full resolved to take a wifeAnd turn her out to who will take her in:Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;For me and my possessions she esteems not.VALENTINEWhat would your Grace have me to do in this?DUKEThere is a lady in Verona hereWhom I affect; but she is nice and coyAnd nought esteems my aged eloquence:Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--For long agone I have forgot to court;Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--How and which way I may bestow myselfTo be regarded in her sun-bright eye.VALENTINEWin her with gifts, if she respect not words:Dumb jewels often in their silent kindMore than quick words do move a woman's mind.DUKEBut she did scorn a present that I sent her.VALENTINEA woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.Send her another; never give her o'er;For scorn at first makes after-love the more.If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,But rather to beget more love in you:If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.DUKEBut she I mean is promised by her friendsUnto a youthful gentleman of worth,And kept severely from resort of men,That no man hath access by day to her.VALENTINEWhy, then, I would resort to her by night.DUKEAy, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,That no man hath recourse to her by night.VALENTINEWhat lets but one may enter at her window?DUKEHer chamber is aloft, far from the ground,And built so shelving that one cannot climb itWithout apparent hazard of his life.VALENTINEWhy then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,So bold Leander would adventure it.DUKENow, as thou art a gentleman of blood,Advise me where I may have such a ladder.VALENTINEWhen would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.DUKEThis very night; for Love is like a child,That longs for every thing that he can come by.VALENTINEBy seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.DUKEBut, hark thee; I will go to her alone:How shall I best convey the ladder thither?VALENTINEIt will be light, my lord, that you may bear itUnder a cloak that is of any length.DUKEA cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?VALENTINEAy, my good lord.DUKEThen let me see thy cloak:I'll get me one of such another length.VALENTINEWhy, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.DUKEHow shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!And here an engine fit for my proceeding.I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.Reads'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,And slaves they are to me that send them flying:O, could their master come and go as lightly,Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:While I, their king, that hither them importune,Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,Because myself do want my servants' fortune:I curse myself, for they are sent by me,That they should harbour where their lord would be.'What's here?'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.''Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly carAnd with thy daring folly burn the world?Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?Go, base intruder! overweening slave!Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,And think my patience, more than thy desert,Is privilege for thy departure hence:Thank me for this more than for all the favoursWhich all too much I have bestow'd on thee.But if thou linger in my territoriesLonger than swiftest expeditionWill give thee time to leave our royal court,By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the loveI ever bore my daughter or thyself.Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.ExitVALENTINEAnd why not death rather than living torment?To die is to be banish'd from myself;And Silvia is myself: banish'd from herIs self from self: a deadly banishment!What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?Unless it be to think that she is byAnd feed upon the shadow of perfectionExcept I be by Silvia in the night,There is no music in the nightingale;Unless I look on Silvia in the day,There is no day for me to look upon;She is my essence, and I leave to be,If I be not by her fair influenceFoster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:Tarry I here, I but attend on death:But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCEPROTEUSRun, boy, run, run, and seek him out.LAUNCESoho, soho!PROTEUSWhat seest thou?LAUNCEHim we go to find: there's not a hair on's headbut 'tis a Valentine.PROTEUSValentine?VALENTINENo.PROTEUSWho then? his spirit?VALENTINENeither.PROTEUSWhat then?VALENTINENothing.LAUNCECan nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?PROTEUSWho wouldst thou strike?LAUNCENothing.PROTEUSVillain, forbear.LAUNCEWhy, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--PROTEUSSirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.VALENTINEMy ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,So much of bad already hath possess'd them.PROTEUSThen in dumb silence will I bury mine,For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.VALENTINEIs Silvia dead?PROTEUSNo, Valentine.VALENTINENo Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.Hath she forsworn me?PROTEUSNo, Valentine.VALENTINENo Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.What is your news?LAUNCESir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.PROTEUSThat thou art banished--O, that's the news!--From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.VALENTINEO, I have fed upon this woe already,And now excess of it will make me surfeit.Doth Silvia know that I am banished?PROTEUSAy, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;With them, upon her knees, her humble self;Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became themAs if but now they waxed pale for woe:But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.Besides, her intercession chafed him so,When she for thy repeal was suppliant,That to close prison he commanded her,With many bitter threats of biding there.VALENTINENo more; unless the next word that thou speak'stHave some malignant power upon my life:If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,As ending anthem of my endless dolour.PROTEUSCease to lament for that thou canst not help,And study help for that which thou lament'st.Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with thatAnd manage it against despairing thoughts.Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'dEven in the milk-white bosom of thy love.The time now serves not to expostulate:Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;And, ere I part with thee, confer at largeOf all that may concern thy love-affairs.As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,Regard thy danger, and along with me!VALENTINEI pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.PROTEUSGo, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.VALENTINEO my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUSLAUNCEI am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit tothink my master is a kind of a knave: but that'sall one, if he be but one knave. He lives not nowthat knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but ateam of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, Iwill not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tisa maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves forwages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;which is much in a bare Christian.Pulling out a paperHere is the cate-log of her condition.'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horsecan do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but onlycarry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maidwith clean hands.Enter SPEEDSPEEDHow now, Signior Launce! what news with yourmastership?LAUNCEWith my master's ship? why, it is at sea.SPEEDWell, your old vice still; mistake the word. Whatnews, then, in your paper?LAUNCEThe blackest news that ever thou heardest.SPEEDWhy, man, how black?LAUNCEWhy, as black as ink.SPEEDLet me read them.LAUNCEFie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.SPEEDThou liest; I can.LAUNCEI will try thee.

Is your countrymanAccording to our proclamation gone?PROTEUSGone, my good lord.DUKEMy daughter takes his going grievously.PROTEUSA little time, my lord, will kill that grief.DUKESo I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--Makes me the better to confer with thee.PROTEUSLonger than I prove loyal to your graceLet me not live to look upon your grace.DUKEThou know'st how willingly I would effectThe match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.PROTEUSI do, my lord.DUKEAnd also, I think, thou art not ignorantHow she opposes her against my willPROTEUSShe did, my lord, when Valentine was here.DUKEAy, and perversely she persevers so.What might we do to make the girl forgetThe love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?PROTEUSThe best way is to slander ValentineWith falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,Three things that women highly hold in hate.DUKEAy, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.PROTEUSAy, if his enemy deliver it:Therefore it must with circumstance be spokenBy one whom she esteemeth as his friend.DUKEThen you must undertake to slander him.PROTEUSAnd that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,Especially against his very friend.DUKEWhere your good word cannot advantage him,Your slander never can endamage him;Therefore the office is indifferent,Being entreated to it by your friend.PROTEUSYou have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do itBy ought that I can speak in his dispraise,She shall not long continue love to him.But say this weed her love from Valentine,It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.THURIOTherefore, as you unwind her love from him,Lest it should ravel and be good to none,You must provide to bottom it on me;Which must be done by praising me as muchAs you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.DUKEAnd, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,Because we know, on Valentine's report,You are already Love's firm votaryAnd cannot soon revolt and change your mind.Upon this warrant shall you have accessWhere you with Silvia may confer at large;For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;Where you may temper her by your persuasionTo hate young Valentine and love my friend.PROTEUSAs much as I can do, I will effect:But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;You must lay lime to tangle her desiresBy wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymesShould be full-fraught with serviceable vows.DUKEAy,Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.PROTEUSSay that upon the altar of her beautyYou sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:Write till your ink be dry, and with your tearsMoist it again, and frame some feeling lineThat may discover such integrity:For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,Make tigers tame and huge leviathansForsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.After your dire-lamenting elegies,Visit by night your lady's chamber-windowWith some sweet concert; to their instrumentsTune a deploring dump: the night's dead silenceWill well become such sweet-complaining grievance.This, or else nothing, will inherit her.DUKEThis discipline shows thou hast been in love.THURIOAnd thy advice this night I'll put in practise.Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,Let us into the city presentlyTo sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.I have a sonnet that will serve the turnTo give the onset to thy good advice.DUKEAbout it, gentlemen!PROTEUSWe'll wait upon your grace till after supper,And afterward determine our proceedings.DUKEEven now about it!

I was sent to deliverhim as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but hesteps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himselfin all companies! I would have, as one should say,one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not hadmore wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as Ilive, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. Hethrusts me himself into the company of three or fourgentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he hadnot been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, butall the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' saysone: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip himout' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.I, having been acquainted with the smell before,knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow thatwhips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whipthe dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do himthe more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing youwot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me outof the chamber. How many masters would do this forhis servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in thestocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he hadbeen executed; I have stood on the pillory for geesehe hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember thetrick you served me when I took my leave of MadamSilvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as Ido? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and makewater against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didstthou ever see me do such a trick?Enter PROTEUS and JULIAPROTEUSSebastian is thy name?

That's her chamber. Tell my ladyI claim the promise for her heavenly picture.Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.ExitJULIAHow many women would do such a message?Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'dA fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.Alas, poor fool! why do I pity himThat with his very heart despiseth me?Because he loves her, he despiseth me;Because I love him I must pity him.This ring I gave him when he parted from me,To bind him to remember my good will;And now am I, unhappy messenger,To plead for that which I would not obtain,To carry that which I would have refused,To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.I am my master's true-confirmed love;But cannot be true servant to my master,Unless I prove false traitor to myself.Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldlyAs, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.Enter SILVIA, attendedGentlewoman, good day!

O thou senseless form,Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!And, were there sense in his idolatry,My substance should be statue in thy stead.I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyesTo make my master out of love with thee!ExitACT VSCENE I.

Another part of the forest.Enter VALENTINEVALENTINEHow use doth breed a habit in a man!This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,And to the nightingale's complaining notesTune my distresses and record my woes.O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,Lest, growing ruinous, the building fallAnd leave no memory of what it was!Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!What halloing and what stir is this to-day?These are my mates, that make their wills their law,Have some unhappy passenger in chase.They love me well; yet I have much to doTo keep them from uncivil outrages.Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIAPROTEUSMadam, this service I have done for you,Though you respect not aught your servant doth,To hazard life and rescue you from himThat would have forced your honour and your love;Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;A smaller boon than this I cannot begAnd less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.VALENTINE[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.SILVIAO miserable, unhappy that I am!PROTEUSUnhappy were you, madam, ere I came;But by my coming I have made you happy.SILVIABy thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.JULIA[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.SILVIAHad I been seized by a hungry lion,I would have been a breakfast to the beast,Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!And full as much, for more there cannot be,I do detest false perjured Proteus.Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.PROTEUSWhat dangerous action, stood it next to death,Would I not undergo for one calm look!O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,When women cannot love where they're beloved!SILVIAWhen Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faithInto a thousand oaths; and all those oathsDescended into perjury, to love me.Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;And that's far worse than none; better have noneThan plural faith which is too much by one:Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!PROTEUSIn loveWho respects friend?SILVIAAll men but Proteus.PROTEUSNay, if the gentle spirit of moving wordsCan no way change you to a milder form,I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.SILVIAO heaven!PROTEUSI'll force thee yield to my desire.VALENTINERuffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,Thou friend of an ill fashion!PROTEUSValentine!VALENTINEThou common friend, that's without faith or love,For such is a friend now; treacherous man!Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eyeCould have persuaded me: now I dare not sayI have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.Who should be trusted, when one's own right handIs perjured to the bosom? Proteus,I am sorry I must never trust thee more,But count the world a stranger for thy sake.The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!PROTEUSMy shame and guilt confounds me.Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrowBe a sufficient ransom for offence,I tender 't here; I do as truly sufferAs e'er I did commit.VALENTINEThen I am paid;And once again I do receive thee honest.Who by repentance is not satisfiedIs nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:And, that my love may appear plain and free,All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.JULIAO me unhappy!SwoonsPROTEUSLook to the boy.VALENTINEWhy, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?Look up; speak.JULIAO good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ringto Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.PROTEUSWhere is that ring, boy?JULIAHere 'tis; this is it.PROTEUSHow! let me see:Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.JULIAO, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:This is the ring you sent to Silvia.PROTEUSBut how camest thou by this ring? At my departI gave this unto Julia.JULIAAnd Julia herself did give it me;And Julia herself hath brought it hither.PROTEUSHow! Julia!JULIABehold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!Be thou ashamed that I have took upon meSuch an immodest raiment, if shame liveIn a disguise of love:It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,Women to change their shapes than men their minds.PROTEUSThan men their minds! 'tis true.O heaven! were manBut constant, he were perfect. That one errorFills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.What is in Silvia's face, but I may spyMore fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?VALENTINECome, come, a hand from either:Let me be blest to make this happy close;'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.PROTEUSBear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.JULIAAnd I mine.Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIOOutlawsA prize, a prize, a prize!VALENTINEForbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,Banished Valentine.DUKESir Valentine!THURIOYonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.VALENTINEThurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;Come not within the measure of my wrath;Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;Take but possession of her with a touch:I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.THURIOSir Valentine, I care not for her, I;I hold him but a fool that will endangerHis body for a girl that loves him not:I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.DUKEThe more degenerate and base art thou,To make such means for her as thou hast doneAnd leave her on such slight conditions.Now, by the honour of my ancestry,I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,And think thee worthy of an empress' love:Know then, I here forget all former griefs,Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,Thou art a gentleman and well derived;Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.VALENTINEI thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.DUKEI grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.VALENTINEThese banish'd men that I have kept withalAre men endued with worthy qualities:Forgive them what they have committed hereAnd let them be recall'd from their exile:They are reformed, civil, full of goodAnd fit for great employment, worthy lord.DUKEThou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.Come, let us go: we will include all jarsWith triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.VALENTINEAnd, as we walk along, I dare be boldWith our discourse to make your grace to smile.What think you of this page, my lord?DUKEI think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.VALENTINEI warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.DUKEWhat mean you by that saying?VALENTINEPlease you, I'll tell you as we pass along,That you will wonder what hath fortuned.Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hearThe story of your loves discovered:That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.Exeunt
