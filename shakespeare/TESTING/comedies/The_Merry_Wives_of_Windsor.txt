Does he lie atthe Garter?PAGEAy, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyagetowards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; andwhat he gets more of her than sharp words, let itlie on my head.FORDI do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath toturn them together.

Why, thou unconfinablebaseness, it is as much as I can do to keep theterms of my honour precise: I, I, I myselfsometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left handand hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain toshuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountainlooks, your red-lattice phrases, and yourbold-beating oaths, under the shelter of yourhonour!

Well, heaven forgive you and allof us, I pray!FALSTAFFMistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--MISTRESS QUICKLYMarry, this is the short and the long of it; youhave brought her into such a canaries as 'tiswonderful. The best courtier of them all, when thecourt lay at Windsor, could never have brought herto such a canary. Yet there has been knights, andlords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrantyou, coach after coach, letter after letter, giftafter gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and sorushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and insuch alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar ofthe best and the fairest, that would have won anywoman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could neverget an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angelsgiven me this morning; but I defy all angels, inany such sort, as they say, but in the way ofhonesty: and, I warrant you, they could never gether so much as sip on a cup with the proudest ofthem all: and yet there has been earls, nay, whichis more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.FALSTAFFBut what says she to me? be brief, my goodshe-Mercury.MISTRESS QUICKLYMarry, she hath received your letter, for the whichshe thanks you a thousand times; and she gives youto notify that her husband will be absence from hishouse between ten and eleven.FALSTAFFTen and eleven?MISTRESS QUICKLYAy, forsooth; and then you may come and see thepicture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweetwoman leads an ill life with him: he's a veryjealousy man: she leads a very frampold life withhim, good heart.FALSTAFFTen and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I willnot fail her.MISTRESS QUICKLYWhy, you say well. But I have another messenger toyour worship. Mistress Page hath her heartycommendations to you too: and let me tell you inyour ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, andone, I tell you, that will not miss you morning norevening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be theother: and she bade me tell your worship that herhusband is seldom from home; but she hopes therewill come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upona man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.FALSTAFFNot I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of mygood parts aside I have no other charms.MISTRESS QUICKLYBlessing on your heart for't!FALSTAFFBut, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife andPage's wife acquainted each other how they love me?MISTRESS QUICKLYThat were a jest indeed! they have not so littlegrace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! butMistress Page would desire you to send her yourlittle page, of all loves: her husband has amarvellous infection to the little page; and trulyMaster Page is an honest man. Never a wife inWindsor leads a better life than she does: do whatshe will, say what she will, take all, pay all, goto bed when she list, rise when she list, all is asshe will: and truly she deserves it; for if therebe a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You mustsend her your page; no remedy.FALSTAFFWhy, I will.MISTRESS QUICKLYNay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come andgo between you both; and in any case have anay-word, that you may know one another's mind, andthe boy never need to understand any thing; for'tis not good that children should know anywickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,as they say, and know the world.FALSTAFFFare thee well: commend me to them both: there'smy purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along withthis woman.Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBINThis news distracts me!PISTOLThis punk is one of Cupid's carriers:Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!ExitFALSTAFFSayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll makemore of thy old body than I have done.

Give us leave, drawer.Exit BARDOLPHFORDSir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.FALSTAFFGood Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.FORDGood Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;for I must let you understand I think myself inbetter plight for a lender than you are: the whichhath something embolden'd me to this unseasonedintrusion; for they say, if money go before, allways do lie open.FALSTAFFMoney is a good soldier, sir, and will on.FORDTroth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, orhalf, for easing me of the carriage.FALSTAFFSir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.FORDI will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.FALSTAFFSpeak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to beyour servant.FORDSir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be briefwith you,--and you have been a man long known to me,though I had never so good means, as desire, to makemyself acquainted with you. I shall discover athing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mineown imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you haveone eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,turn another into the register of your own; that Imay pass with a reproof the easier, sith youyourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.FALSTAFFVery well, sir; proceed.FORDThere is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband'sname is Ford.FALSTAFFWell, sir.FORDI have long loved her, and, I protest to you,bestowed much on her; followed her with a dotingobservance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardlygive me sight of her; not only bought many presentsto give her, but have given largely to many to knowwhat she would have given; briefly, I have pursuedher as love hath pursued me; which hath been on thewing of all occasions. But whatsoever I havemerited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,I am sure, I have received none; unless experiencebe a jewel that I have purchased at an infiniterate, and that hath taught me to say this:'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'FALSTAFFHave you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?FORDNever.FALSTAFFHave you importuned her to such a purpose?FORDNever.FALSTAFFOf what quality was your love, then?FORDLike a fair house built on another man's ground; sothat I have lost my edifice by mistaking the placewhere I erected it.FALSTAFFTo what purpose have you unfolded this to me?FORDWhen I have told you that, I have told you all.Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet inother places she enlargeth her mirth so far thatthere is shrewd construction made of her. Now, SirJohn, here is the heart of my purpose: you are agentleman of excellent breeding, admirablediscourse, of great admittance, authentic in yourplace and person, generally allowed for your manywar-like, court-like, and learned preparations.FALSTAFFO, sir!FORDBelieve it, for you know it. There is money; spendit, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; onlygive me so much of your time in exchange of it, asto lay an amiable siege to the honesty of thisFord's wife: use your art of wooing; win her toconsent to you: if any man may, you may as soon asany.FALSTAFFWould it apply well to the vehemency of youraffection, that I should win what you would enjoy?Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.FORDO, understand my drift. She dwells so securely onthe excellency of her honour, that the folly of mysoul dares not present itself: she is too bright tobe looked against. Now, could I could come to herwith any detection in my hand, my desires hadinstance and argument to commend themselves: Icould drive her then from the ward of her purity,her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousandother her defences, which now are too too stronglyembattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?FALSTAFFMaster Brook, I will first make bold with yourmoney; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am agentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.FORDO good sir!FALSTAFFI say you shall.FORDWant no money, Sir John; you shall want none.FALSTAFFWant no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall wantnone. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by herown appointment; even as you came in to me, herassistant or go-between parted from me: I say Ishall be with her between ten and eleven; for atthat time the jealous rascally knave her husbandwill be forth. Come you to me at night; you shallknow how I speed.FORDI am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,sir?FALSTAFFHang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say thejealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for thewhich his wife seems to me well-favored. I willuse her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;and there's my harvest-home.FORDI would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid himif you saw him.FALSTAFFHang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I willstare him out of his wits; I will awe him with mycudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er thecuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know Iwill predominate over the peasant, and thou shaltlie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave andcuckold. Come to me soon at night.ExitFORDWhat a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart isready to crack with impatience. Who says this isimprovident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; thehour is fixed; the match is made. Would any manhave thought this? See the hell of having a falsewoman! My bed shall be abused, my coffersransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall notonly receive this villanous wrong, but stand underthe adoption of abominable terms, and by him thatdoes me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon soundswell; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they aredevils' additions, the names of fiends: butCuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hathnot such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: hewill trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I willrather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hughthe Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with myaqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my amblinggelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,then she ruminates, then she devises; and what theythink in their hearts they may effect, they willbreak their hearts but they will effect. God bepraised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged onFalstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;better three hours too soon than a minute too late.Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!ExitSCENE III.

The roguesslighted me into the river with as little remorse asthey would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my sizethat I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if thebottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I hadbeen drowned, but that the shore was shelvy andshallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swellsa man; and what a thing should I have been when Ihad been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.Re-enter BARDOLPH with sackBARDOLPHHere's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.FALSTAFFLet me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for mybelly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs forpills to cool the reins.

Her husband goes this morninga-birding; she desires you once more to come to herbetween eight and nine: I must carry her wordquickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.FALSTAFFWell, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid herthink what a man is: let her consider his frailty,and then judge of my merit.MISTRESS QUICKLYI will tell her.FALSTAFFDo so.

Did she change her determination?FALSTAFFNo, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto herhusband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of ourencounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thitherprovoked and instigated by his distemper, and,forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.FORDWhat, while you were there?FALSTAFFWhile I was there.FORDAnd did he search for you, and could not find you?FALSTAFFYou shall hear. As good luck would have it, comesin one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford'sapproach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife'sdistraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.FORDA buck-basket!FALSTAFFBy the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foulshirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasynapkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankestcompound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.FORDAnd how long lay you there?FALSTAFFNay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I havesuffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford'sknaves, his hinds, were called forth by theirmistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes toDatchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; metthe jealous knave their master in the door, whoasked them once or twice what they had in theirbasket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knavewould have searched it; but fate, ordaining heshould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went hefor a search, and away went I for foul clothes. Butmark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangsof three several deaths; first, an intolerablefright, to be detected with a jealous rottenbell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a goodbilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt topoint, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,like a strong distillation, with stinking clothesthat fretted in their own grease: think of that,--aman of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subjectto heat as butter; a man of continual dissolutionand thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.And in the height of this bath, when I was more thanhalf stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to bethrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think ofthat,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.FORDIn good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake youhave sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;you'll undertake her no more?FALSTAFFMaster Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I havebeen into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Herhusband is this morning gone a-birding: I havereceived from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixteight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.FORD'Tis past eight already, sir.FALSTAFFIs it? I will then address me to my appointment.Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shallknow how I speed; and the conclusion shall becrowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shallhave her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shallcuckold Ford.ExitFORDHum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do Isleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linenand buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myselfwhat I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at myhouse; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible heshould; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil thatguides him should aid him, I will searchimpossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb gowith me: I'll be horn-mad.ExitACT IVSCENE I.

Now, thus it rests:Her father means she shall be all in white,And in that habit, when Slender sees his timeTo take her by the hand and bid her go,She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,The better to denote her to the doctor,For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,The maid hath given consent to go with him.HostWhich means she to deceive, father or mother?FENTONBoth, my good host, to go along with me:And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicarTo stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,And, in the lawful name of marrying,To give our hearts united ceremony.HostWell, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.FENTONSo shall I evermore be bound to thee;Besides, I'll make a present recompense.ExeuntACT VSCENE I.

Thisis enough to be the decay of lust and late-walkingthrough the realm.MISTRESS PAGEWhy Sir John, do you think, though we would have thevirtue out of our hearts by the head and shouldersand have given ourselves without scruple to hell,that ever the devil could have made you our delight?FORDWhat, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?MISTRESS PAGEA puffed man?PAGEOld, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?FORDAnd one that is as slanderous as Satan?PAGEAnd as poor as Job?FORDAnd as wicked as his wife?SIR HUGH EVANSAnd given to fornications, and to taverns and sackand wine and metheglins, and to drinkings andswearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?FALSTAFFWell, I am your theme: you have the start of me; Iam dejected; I am not able to answer the Welshflannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: useme as you will.FORDMarry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to oneMaster Brook, that you have cozened of money, towhom you should have been a pander: over and abovethat you have suffered, I think to repay that moneywill be a biting affliction.PAGEYet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a possetto-night at my house; where I will desire thee tolaugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell herMaster Slender hath married her daughter.MISTRESS PAGE[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be mydaughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.Enter SLENDERSLENDERWhoa ho! ho, father Page!PAGESon, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?SLENDERDispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershireknow on't; would I were hanged, la, else.PAGEOf what, son?SLENDERI came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not beeni' the church, I would have swinged him, or heshould have swinged me. If I did not think it hadbeen Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tisa postmaster's boy.PAGEUpon my life, then, you took the wrong.SLENDERWhat need you tell me that? I think so, when I tooka boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, forall he was in woman's apparel, I would not have hadhim.PAGEWhy, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you howyou should know my daughter by her garments?SLENDERI went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and shecried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yetit was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.MISTRESS PAGEGood George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she isnow with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.Enter DOCTOR CAIUSDOCTOR CAIUSVere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.MISTRESS PAGEWhy, did you take her in green?DOCTOR CAIUSAy, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.ExitFORDThis is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?PAGEMy heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGEHow now, Master Fenton!ANNE PAGEPardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!PAGENow, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?MISTRESS PAGEWhy went you not with master doctor, maid?FENTONYou do amaze her: hear the truth of it.You would have married her most shamefully,Where there was no proportion held in love.The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.The offence is holy that she hath committed;And this deceit loses the name of craft,Of disobedience, or unduteous title,Since therein she doth evitate and shunA thousand irreligious cursed hours,Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.FORDStand not amazed; here is no remedy:In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.FALSTAFFI am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand tostrike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.PAGEWell, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.FALSTAFFWhen night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.MISTRESS PAGEWell, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,Heaven give you many, many merry days!Good husband, let us every one go home,And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;Sir John and all.FORDLet it be so. Sir John,To Master Brook you yet shall hold your wordFor he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.Exeunt
