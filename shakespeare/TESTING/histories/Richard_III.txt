ACT ISCENE I. London. A street.Enter GLOUCESTER, solusGLOUCESTERNow is the winter of our discontentMade glorious summer by this sun of York;And all the clouds that lour'd upon our houseIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried.Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;And now, instead of mounting barded steedsTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries,He capers nimbly in a lady's chamberTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute.But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majestyTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my timeInto this breathing world, scarce half made up,And that so lamely and unfashionableThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them;Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,Have no delight to pass away the time,Unless to spy my shadow in the sunAnd descant on mine own deformity:And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,To entertain these fair well-spoken days,I am determined to prove a villainAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days.Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,To set my brother Clarence and the kingIn deadly hate the one against the other:And if King Edward be as true and justAs I am subtle, false and treacherous,This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,About a prophecy, which says that 'G'Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: hereClarence comes.Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURYBrother, good day; what means this armed guardThat waits upon your grace?CLARENCEHis majestyTendering my person's safety, hath appointedThis conduct to convey me to the Tower.GLOUCESTERUpon what cause?CLARENCEBecause my name is George.GLOUCESTERAlack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;He should, for that, commit your godfathers:O, belike his majesty hath some intentThat you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?CLARENCEYea, Richard, when I know; for I protestAs yet I do not: but, as I can learn,He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.And says a wizard told him that by GHis issue disinherited should be;And, for my name of George begins with G,It follows in his thought that I am he.These, as I learn, and such like toys as theseHave moved his highness to commit me now.GLOUCESTERWhy, this it is, when men are ruled by women:'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis sheThat tempers him to this extremity.Was it not she and that good man of worship,Anthony Woodville, her brother there,That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,From whence this present day he is deliver'd?We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.CLARENCEBy heaven, I think there's no man is secureBut the queen's kindred and night-walking heraldsThat trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.Heard ye not what an humble suppliantLord hastings was to her for his delivery?GLOUCESTERHumbly complaining to her deityGot my lord chamberlain his liberty.I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,If we will keep in favour with the king,To be her men and wear her livery:The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.BRAKENBURYI beseech your graces both to pardon me;His majesty hath straitly given in chargeThat no man shall have private conference,Of what degree soever, with his brother.GLOUCESTEREven so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,You may partake of any thing we say:We speak no treason, man: we say the kingIs wise and virtuous, and his noble queenWell struck in years, fair, and not jealous;We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:How say you sir? Can you deny all this?BRAKENBURYWith this, my lord, myself have nought to do.GLOUCESTERNaught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,He that doth naught with her, excepting one,Were best he do it secretly, alone.BRAKENBURYWhat one, my lord?GLOUCESTERHer husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?BRAKENBURYI beseech your grace to pardon me, and withalForbear your conference with the noble duke.CLARENCEWe know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.GLOUCESTERWe are the queen's abjects, and must obey.Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;And whatsoever you will employ me in,Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,I will perform it to enfranchise you.Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhoodTouches me deeper than you can imagine.CLARENCEI know it pleaseth neither of us well.GLOUCESTERWell, your imprisonment shall not be long;Meantime, have patience.CLARENCEI must perforce. Farewell.Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and GuardGLOUCESTERGo, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,If heaven will take the present at our hands.But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?Enter HASTINGSHASTINGSGood time of day unto my gracious lord!GLOUCESTERAs much unto my good lord chamberlain!Well are you welcome to the open air.How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?HASTINGSWith patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanksThat were the cause of my imprisonment.GLOUCESTERNo doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;For they that were your enemies are his,And have prevail'd as much on him as you.HASTINGSMore pity that the eagle should be mew'd,While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.GLOUCESTERWhat news abroad?HASTINGSNo news so bad abroad as this at home;The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,And his physicians fear him mightily.GLOUCESTERNow, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.O, he hath kept an evil diet long,And overmuch consumed his royal person:'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.What, is he in his bed?HASTINGSHe is.GLOUCESTERGo you before, and I will follow you.Exit HASTINGSHe cannot live, I hope; and must not dieTill George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;And, if I fall not in my deep intent,Clarence hath not another day to live:Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,And leave the world for me to bustle in!For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.What though I kill'd her husband and her father?The readiest way to make the wench amendsIs to become her husband and her father:The which will I; not all so much for loveAs for another secret close intent,By marrying her which I must reach unto.But yet I run before my horse to market:Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:When they are gone, then must I count my gains.ExitSCENE II. The same. Another street.Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mournerLADY ANNESet down, set down your honourable load,If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,Whilst I awhile obsequiously lamentThe untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!More direful hap betide that hated wretch,That makes us wretched by the death of thee,Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!If ever he have child, abortive be it,Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,Whose ugly and unnatural aspectMay fright the hopeful mother at the view;And that be heir to his unhappiness!If ever he have wife, let her he madeA miserable by the death of himAs I am made by my poor lord and thee!Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,Taken from Paul's to be interred there;And still, as you are weary of the weight,Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.Enter GLOUCESTERGLOUCESTERStay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.LADY ANNEWhat black magician conjures up this fiend,To stop devoted charitable deeds?GLOUCESTERVillains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.GentlemanMy lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.GLOUCESTERUnmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.LADY ANNEWhat, do you tremble? are you all afraid?Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.GLOUCESTERSweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.LADY ANNEFoul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's woundsOpen their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;For 'tis thy presence that exhales this bloodFrom cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,Provokes this deluge most unnatural.O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!Either heaven with lightning strike themurderer dead,Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,As thou dost swallow up this good king's bloodWhich his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!GLOUCESTERLady, you know no rules of charity,Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.LADY ANNEVillain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.GLOUCESTERBut I know none, and therefore am no beast.LADY ANNEO wonderful, when devils tell the truth!GLOUCESTERMore wonderful, when angels are so angry.Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,By circumstance, but to acquit myself.LADY ANNEVouchsafe, defused infection of a man,For these known evils, but to give me leave,By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.GLOUCESTERFairer than tongue can name thee, let me haveSome patient leisure to excuse myself.LADY ANNEFouler than heart can think thee, thou canst makeNo excuse current, but to hang thyself.GLOUCESTERBy such despair, I should accuse myself.LADY ANNEAnd, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.GLOUCESTERSay that I slew them not?LADY ANNEWhy, then they are not dead:But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.GLOUCESTERI did not kill your husband.LADY ANNEWhy, then he is alive.GLOUCESTERNay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.LADY ANNEIn thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret sawThy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;The which thou once didst bend against her breast,But that thy brothers beat aside the point.GLOUCESTERI was provoked by her slanderous tongue,which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.LADY ANNEThou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:Didst thou not kill this king?GLOUCESTERI grant ye.LADY ANNEDost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me tooThou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!GLOUCESTERThe fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.LADY ANNEHe is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.GLOUCESTERLet him thank me, that holp to send him thither;For he was fitter for that place than earth.LADY ANNEAnd thou unfit for any place but hell.GLOUCESTERYes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.LADY ANNESome dungeon.GLOUCESTERYour bed-chamber.LADY ANNEI'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!GLOUCESTERSo will it, madam till I lie with you.LADY ANNEI hope so.GLOUCESTERI know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,To leave this keen encounter of our wits,And fall somewhat into a slower method,Is not the causer of the timeless deathsOf these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,As blameful as the executioner?LADY ANNEThou art the cause, and most accursed effect.GLOUCESTERYour beauty was the cause of that effect;Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleepTo undertake the death of all the world,So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.LADY ANNEIf I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.GLOUCESTERThese eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;You should not blemish it, if I stood by:As all the world is cheered by the sun,So I by that; it is my day, my life.LADY ANNEBlack night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!GLOUCESTERCurse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.LADY ANNEI would I were, to be revenged on thee.GLOUCESTERIt is a quarrel most unnatural,To be revenged on him that loveth you.LADY ANNEIt is a quarrel just and reasonable,To be revenged on him that slew my husband.GLOUCESTERHe that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,Did it to help thee to a better husband.LADY ANNEHis better doth not breathe upon the earth.GLOUCESTERHe lives that loves thee better than he could.LADY ANNEName him.GLOUCESTERPlantagenet.LADY ANNEWhy, that was he.GLOUCESTERThe selfsame name, but one of better nature.LADY ANNEWhere is he?GLOUCESTERHere.She spitteth at himWhy dost thou spit at me?LADY ANNEWould it were mortal poison, for thy sake!GLOUCESTERNever came poison from so sweet a place.LADY ANNENever hung poison on a fouler toad.Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.GLOUCESTERThine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.LADY ANNEWould they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!GLOUCESTERI would they were, that I might die at once;For now they kill me with a living death.Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,No, when my father York and Edward wept,To hear the piteous moan that Rutland madeWhen black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,Told the sad story of my father's death,And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,That all the standers-by had wet their cheeksLike trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad timeMy manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.I never sued to friend nor enemy;My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.She looks scornfully at himTeach not thy lips such scorn, for they were madeFor kissing, lady, not for such contempt.If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,And humbly beg the death upon my knee.He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his swordNay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.Here she lets fall the swordTake up the sword again, or take up me.LADY ANNEArise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,I will not be the executioner.GLOUCESTERThen bid me kill myself, and I will do it.LADY ANNEI have already.GLOUCESTERTush, that was in thy rage:Speak it again, and, even with the word,That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.LADY ANNEI would I knew thy heart.GLOUCESTER'Tis figured in my tongue.LADY ANNEI fear me both are false.GLOUCESTERThen never man was true.LADY ANNEWell, well, put up your sword.GLOUCESTERSay, then, my peace is made.LADY ANNEThat shall you know hereafter.GLOUCESTERBut shall I live in hope?LADY ANNEAll men, I hope, live so.GLOUCESTERVouchsafe to wear this ring.LADY ANNETo take is not to give.GLOUCESTERLook, how this ring encompasseth finger.Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.And if thy poor devoted suppliant mayBut beg one favour at thy gracious hand,Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.LADY ANNEWhat is it?GLOUCESTERThat it would please thee leave these sad designsTo him that hath more cause to be a mourner,And presently repair to Crosby Place;Where, after I have solemnly interr'dAt Chertsey monastery this noble king,And wet his grave with my repentant tears,I will with all expedient duty see you:For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,Grant me this boon.LADY ANNEWith all my heart; and much it joys me too,To see you are become so penitent.Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.GLOUCESTERBid me farewell.LADY ANNE'Tis more than you deserve;But since you teach me how to flatter you,Imagine I have said farewell already.Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEYGLOUCESTERSirs, take up the corse.GENTLEMENTowards Chertsey, noble lord?GLOUCESTERNo, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.Exeunt all but GLOUCESTERWas ever woman in this humour woo'd?Was ever woman in this humour won?I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,To take her in her heart's extremest hate,With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,The bleeding witness of her hatred by;Having God, her conscience, and these barsagainst me,And I nothing to back my suit at all,But the plain devil and dissembling looks,And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!Ha!Hath she forgot already that brave prince,Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,Framed in the prodigality of nature,Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,The spacious world cannot again affordAnd will she yet debase her eyes on me,That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,And made her widow to a woful bed?On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?My dukedom to a beggarly denier,I do mistake my person all this while:Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,Myself to be a marvellous proper man.I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,And entertain some score or two of tailors,To study fashions to adorn my body:Since I am crept in favour with myself,Will maintain it with some little cost.But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;And then return lamenting to my love.Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,That I may see my shadow as I pass.ExitSCENE III. The palace.Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREYRIVERSHave patience, madam: there's no doubt his majestyWill soon recover his accustom'd health.GREYIn that you brook it in, it makes him worse:Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.QUEEN ELIZABETHIf he were dead, what would betide of me?RIVERSNo other harm but loss of such a lord.QUEEN ELIZABETHThe loss of such a lord includes all harm.GREYThe heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,To be your comforter when he is gone.QUEEN ELIZABETHOh, he is young and his minorityIs put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,A man that loves not me, nor none of you.RIVERSIs it concluded that he shall be protector?QUEEN ELIZABETHIt is determined, not concluded yet:But so it must be, if the king miscarry.Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBYGREYHere come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.BUCKINGHAMGood time of day unto your royal grace!DERBYGod make your majesty joyful as you have been!QUEEN ELIZABETHThe Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,And loves not me, be you, good lord, assuredI hate not you for her proud arrogance.DERBYI do beseech you, either not believeThe envious slanders of her false accusers;Or, if she be accused in true report,Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceedsFrom wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.RIVERSSaw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?DERBYBut now the Duke of Buckingham and IAre come from visiting his majesty.QUEEN ELIZABETHWhat likelihood of his amendment, lords?BUCKINGHAMMadam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.QUEEN ELIZABETHGod grant him health! Did you confer with him?BUCKINGHAMMadam, we did: he desires to make atonementBetwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;And sent to warn them to his royal presence.QUEEN ELIZABETHWould all were well! but that will never beI fear our happiness is at the highest.Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSETGLOUCESTERThey do me wrong, and I will not endure it:Who are they that complain unto the king,That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightlyThat fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,I must be held a rancorous enemy.Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,But thus his simple truth must be abusedBy silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?RIVERSTo whom in all this presence speaks your grace?GLOUCESTERTo thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?A plague upon you all! His royal person,--Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.QUEEN ELIZABETHBrother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.The king, of his own royal disposition,And not provoked by any suitor else;Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,Which in your outward actions shows itselfAgainst my kindred, brothers, and myself,Makes him to send; that thereby he may gatherThe ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.GLOUCESTERI cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:Since every Jack became a gentlemanThere's many a gentle person made a Jack.QUEEN ELIZABETHCome, come, we know your meaning, brotherGloucester;You envy my advancement and my friends':God grant we never may have need of you!GLOUCESTERMeantime, God grants that we have need of you:Your brother is imprison'd by your means,Myself disgraced, and the nobilityHeld in contempt; whilst many fair promotionsAre daily given to ennoble thoseThat scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.QUEEN ELIZABETHBy Him that raised me to this careful heightFrom that contented hap which I enjoy'd,I never did incense his majestyAgainst the Duke of Clarence, but have beenAn earnest advocate to plead for him.My lord, you do me shameful injury,Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.GLOUCESTERYou may deny that you were not the causeOf my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.RIVERSShe may, my lord, for--GLOUCESTERShe may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?She may do more, sir, than denying that:She may help you to many fair preferments,And then deny her aiding hand therein,And lay those honours on your high deserts.What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--RIVERSWhat, marry, may she?GLOUCESTERWhat, marry, may she! marry with a king,A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:I wis your grandam had a worser match.QUEEN ELIZABETHMy Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borneYour blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:By heaven, I will acquaint his majestyWith those gross taunts I often have endured.I had rather be a country servant-maidThan a great queen, with this condition,To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behindSmall joy have I in being England's queen.QUEEN MARGARETAnd lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.GLOUCESTERWhat! threat you me with telling of the king?Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have saidI will avouch in presence of the king:I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.QUEEN MARGARETOut, devil! I remember them too well:Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.GLOUCESTEREre you were queen, yea, or your husband king,I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,A liberal rewarder of his friends:To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.QUEEN MARGARETYea, and much better blood than his or thine.GLOUCESTERIn all which time you and your husband GreyWere factious for the house of Lancaster;And, Rivers, so were you.

London. The Tower.Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURYBRAKENBURYWhy looks your grace so heavily today?CLARENCEO, I have pass'd a miserable night,So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,That, as I am a Christian faithful man,I would not spend another such a night,Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,So full of dismal terror was the time!BRAKENBURYWhat was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.CLARENCEMethoughts that I had broken from the Tower,And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;Who from my cabin tempted me to walkUpon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,And cited up a thousand fearful times,During the wars of York and LancasterThat had befall'n us. As we paced alongUpon the giddy footing of the hatches,Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,Into the tumbling billows of the main.Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holesWhere eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.BRAKENBURYHad you such leisure in the time of deathTo gaze upon the secrets of the deep?CLARENCEMethought I had; and often did I striveTo yield the ghost: but still the envious floodKept in my soul, and would not let it forthTo seek the empty, vast and wandering air;But smother'd it within my panting bulk,Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.BRAKENBURYAwaked you not with this sore agony?CLARENCEO, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;O, then began the tempest to my soul,Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,With that grim ferryman which poets write of,Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.The first that there did greet my stranger soul,Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjuryCan this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'And so he vanish'd: then came wandering byA shadow like an angel, with bright hairDabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiendsEnviron'd me about, and howled in mine earsSuch hideous cries, that with the very noiseI trembling waked, and for a season afterCould not believe but that I was in hell,Such terrible impression made the dream.BRAKENBURYNo marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.CLARENCEO Brakenbury, I have done those things,Which now bear evidence against my soul,For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.BRAKENBURYI will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!CLARENCE sleepsSorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.Princes have but their tides for their glories,An outward honour for an inward toil;And, for unfelt imagination,They often feel a world of restless cares:So that, betwixt their tides and low names,There's nothing differs but the outward fame.Enter the two MurderersFirst MurdererHo! who's here?BRAKENBURYIn God's name what are you, and how came you hither?First MurdererI would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.BRAKENBURYYea, are you so brief?Second MurdererO sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Showhim our commission; talk no more.BRAKENBURY reads itBRAKENBURYI am, in this, commanded to deliverThe noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:I will not reason what is meant hereby,Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:I'll to the king; and signify to himThat thus I have resign'd my charge to you.First MurdererDo so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.Exit BRAKENBURYSecond MurdererWhat, shall we stab him as he sleeps?First MurdererNo; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.Second MurdererWhen he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake tillthe judgment-day.First MurdererWhy, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.Second MurdererThe urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kindof remorse in me.First MurdererWhat, art thou afraid?Second MurdererNot to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to bedamned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.First MurdererI thought thou hadst been resolute.Second MurdererSo I am, to let him live.First MurdererBack to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.Second MurdererI pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humourwill change; 'twas wont to hold me but while onewould tell twenty.First MurdererHow dost thou feel thyself now?Second Murderer'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yetwithin me.First MurdererRemember our reward, when the deed is done.Second Murderer'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.First MurdererWhere is thy conscience now?Second MurdererIn the Duke of Gloucester's purse.First MurdererSo when he opens his purse to give us our reward,thy conscience flies out.Second MurdererLet it go; there's few or none will entertain it.First MurdererHow if it come to thee again?Second MurdererI'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: itmakes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but itaccuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but itdetects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit thatmutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full ofobstacles: it made me once restore a purse of goldthat I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: itis turned out of all towns and cities for adangerous thing; and every man that means to livewell endeavours to trust to himself and to livewithout it.First Murderer'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading menot to kill the duke.Second MurdererTake the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: hewould insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.First MurdererTut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,I warrant thee.Second MurdererSpoke like a tail fellow that respects hisreputation. Come, shall we to this gear?First MurdererTake him over the costard with the hilts of thysword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-buttin the next room.Second MurdererO excellent devise! make a sop of him.First MurdererHark! he stirs: shall I strike?Second MurdererNo, first let's reason with him.CLARENCEWhere art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.Second murdererYou shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.CLARENCEIn God's name, what art thou?Second MurdererA man, as you are.CLARENCEBut not, as I am, royal.Second MurdererNor you, as we are, loyal.CLARENCEThy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.Second MurdererMy voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.CLARENCEHow darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?BothTo, to, to--CLARENCETo murder me?BothAy, ay.CLARENCEYou scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?First MurdererOffended us you have not, but the king.CLARENCEI shall be reconciled to him again.Second MurdererNever, my lord; therefore prepare to die.CLARENCEAre you call'd forth from out a world of menTo slay the innocent? What is my offence?Where are the evidence that do accuse me?What lawful quest have given their verdict upUnto the frowning judge? or who pronouncedThe bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?Before I be convict by course of law,To threaten me with death is most unlawful.I charge you, as you hope to have redemptionBy Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,That you depart and lay no hands on meThe deed you undertake is damnable.First MurdererWhat we will do, we do upon command.Second MurdererAnd he that hath commanded is the king.CLARENCEErroneous vassal! the great King of kingsHath in the tables of his law commandedThat thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,To hurl upon their heads that break his law.Second MurdererAnd that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,For false forswearing and for murder too:Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.First MurdererAnd, like a traitor to the name of God,Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous bladeUnrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.Second MurdererWhom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.First MurdererHow canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?CLARENCEAlas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,He sends ye not to murder me for thisFor in this sin he is as deep as I.If God will be revenged for this deed.O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;He needs no indirect nor lawless courseTo cut off those that have offended him.First MurdererWho made thee, then, a bloody minister,When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?CLARENCEMy brother's love, the devil, and my rage.First MurdererThy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.CLARENCEOh, if you love my brother, hate not me;I am his brother, and I love him well.If you be hired for meed, go back again,And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,Who shall reward you better for my lifeThan Edward will for tidings of my death.Second MurdererYou are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.CLARENCEO, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:Go you to him from me.BothAy, so we will.CLARENCETell him, when that our princely father YorkBless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,And charged us from his soul to love each other,He little thought of this divided friendship:Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.First MurdererAy, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.CLARENCEO, do not slander him, for he is kind.First MurdererRight,As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.CLARENCEIt cannot be; for when I parted with him,He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,That he would labour my delivery.Second MurdererWhy, so he doth, now he delivers theeFrom this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.First MurdererMake peace with God, for you must die, my lord.CLARENCEHast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,To counsel me to make my peace with God,And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you onTo do this deed will hate you for the deed.Second MurdererWhat shall we do?CLARENCERelent, and save your souls.First MurdererRelent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.CLARENCENot to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.Which of you, if you were a prince's son,Being pent from liberty, as I am now,if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,Would not entreat for life?My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,As you would beg, were you in my distressA begging prince what beggar pities not?Second MurdererLook behind you, my lord.First MurdererTake that, and that: if all this will not do,Stabs himI'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.Exit, with the bodySecond MurdererA bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my handsOf this most grievous guilty murder done!Re-enter First MurdererFirst MurdererHow now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!Second MurdererI would he knew that I had saved his brother!Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;For I repent me that the duke is slain.ExitFirst MurdererSo do not I: go, coward as thou art.Now must I hide his body in some hole,Until the duke take order for his burial:And when I have my meed, I must away;For this will out, and here I must not stay.ACT IISCENE I.

The same.Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his handScrivenerThis is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,That it may be this day read over in Paul's.And mark how well the sequel hangs together:Eleven hours I spent to write it over,For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;The precedent was full as long a-doing:And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,Untainted, unexamined, free, at libertyHere's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,That seeth not this palpable device?Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.ExitSCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doorsGLOUCESTERHow now, my lord, what say the citizens?BUCKINGHAMNow, by the holy mother of our Lord,The citizens are mum and speak not a word.GLOUCESTERTouch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?BUCKINGHAMI did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,And his contract by deputy in France;The insatiate greediness of his desires,And his enforcement of the city wives;His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,As being got, your father then in France,His resemblance, being not like the duke;Withal I did infer your lineaments,Being the right idea of your father,Both in your form and nobleness of mind;Laid open all your victories in Scotland,Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purposeUntouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourseAnd when mine oratory grew to an endI bid them that did love their country's goodCry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'GLOUCESTERAh! and did they so?BUCKINGHAMNo, so God help me, they spake not a word;But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.Which when I saw, I reprehended them;And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:His answer was, the people were not wontTo be spoke to but by the recorder.Then he was urged to tell my tale again,'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'But nothing spake in warrant from himself.When he had done, some followers of mine own,At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'And thus I took the vantage of those few,'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;'This general applause and loving shoutArgues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'And even here brake off, and came away.GLOUCESTERWhat tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?BUCKINGHAMNo, by my troth, my lord.GLOUCESTERWill not the mayor then and his brethren come?BUCKINGHAMThe mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:And be not easily won to our request:Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.GLOUCESTERI go; and if you plead as well for themAs I can say nay to thee for myself,No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.BUCKINGHAMGo, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.Exit GLOUCESTEREnter the Lord Mayor and CitizensWelcome my lord; I dance attendance here;I think the duke will not be spoke withal.Enter CATESBYHere comes his servant: how now, Catesby,What says he?CATESBYMy lord: he doth entreat your grace;To visit him to-morrow or next day:He is within, with two right reverend fathers,Divinely bent to meditation;And no worldly suit would he be moved,To draw him from his holy exercise.BUCKINGHAMReturn, good Catesby, to thy lord again;Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,In deep designs and matters of great moment,No less importing than our general good,Are come to have some conference with his grace.CATESBYI'll tell him what you say, my lord.ExitBUCKINGHAMAh, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,But on his knees at meditation;Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,But meditating with two deep divines;Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:Happy were England, would this gracious princeTake on himself the sovereignty thereof:But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.Lord MayorMarry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!BUCKINGHAMI fear he will.Re-enter CATESBYHow now, Catesby, what says your lord?CATESBYMy lord,He wonders to what end you have assembledSuch troops of citizens to speak with him,His grace not being warn'd thereof before:My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.BUCKINGHAMSorry I am my noble cousin shouldSuspect me, that I mean no good to him:By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;And so once more return and tell his grace.Exit CATESBYWhen holy and devout religious menAre at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,So sweet is zealous contemplation.Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returnsLord MayorSee, where he stands between two clergymen!BUCKINGHAMTwo props of virtue for a Christian prince,To stay him from the fall of vanity:And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,True ornaments to know a holy man.Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,Lend favourable ears to our request;And pardon us the interruptionOf thy devotion and right Christian zeal.GLOUCESTERMy lord, there needs no such apology:I rather do beseech you pardon me,Who, earnest in the service of my God,Neglect the visitation of my friends.But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?BUCKINGHAMEven that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.GLOUCESTERI do suspect I have done some offenceThat seems disgracious in the city's eyes,And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.BUCKINGHAMYou have, my lord: would it might please your grace,At our entreaties, to amend that fault!GLOUCESTERElse wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?BUCKINGHAMThen know, it is your fault that you resignThe supreme seat, the throne majestical,The scepter'd office of your ancestors,Your state of fortune and your due of birth,The lineal glory of your royal house,To the corruption of a blemished stock:Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,Which here we waken to our country's good,This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;Her face defaced with scars of infamy,Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulfOf blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.Which to recure, we heartily solicitYour gracious self to take on you the chargeAnd kingly government of this your land,Not as protector, steward, substitute,Or lowly factor for another's gain;But as successively from blood to blood,Your right of birth, your empery, your own.For this, consorted with the citizens,Your very worshipful and loving friends,And by their vehement instigation,In this just suit come I to move your grace.GLOUCESTERI know not whether to depart in silence,Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.Best fitteth my degree or your conditionIf not to answer, you might haply thinkTongue-tied ambition, not replying, yieldedTo bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,Which fondly you would here impose on me;If to reprove you for this suit of yours,So season'd with your faithful love to me.Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,Definitively thus I answer you.Your love deserves my thanks; but my desertUnmeritable shuns your high request.First if all obstacles were cut away,And that my path were even to the crown,As my ripe revenue and due by birthYet so much is my poverty of spirit,So mighty and so many my defects,As I had rather hide me from my greatness,Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,Than in my greatness covet to be hid,And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,And much I need to help you, if need were;The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,Will well become the seat of majesty,And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.On him I lay what you would lay on me,The right and fortune of his happy stars;Which God defend that I should wring from him!BUCKINGHAMMy lord, this argues conscience in your grace;But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,All circumstances well considered.You say that Edward is your brother's son:So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--Your mother lives a witness to that vow--And afterward by substitute betroth'dTo Bona, sister to the King of France.These both put by a poor petitioner,A care-crazed mother of a many children,A beauty-waning and distressed widow,Even in the afternoon of her best days,Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughtsTo base declension and loathed bigamyBy her, in his unlawful bed, he gotThis Edward, whom our manners term the prince.More bitterly could I expostulate,Save that, for reverence to some alive,I give a sparing limit to my tongue.Then, good my lord, take to your royal selfThis proffer'd benefit of dignity;If non to bless us and the land withal,Yet to draw forth your noble ancestryFrom the corruption of abusing times,Unto a lineal true-derived course.Lord MayorDo, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.BUCKINGHAMRefuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.CATESBYO, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!GLOUCESTERAlas, why would you heap these cares on me?I am unfit for state and majesty;I do beseech you, take it not amiss;I cannot nor I will not yield to you.BUCKINGHAMIf you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;As well we know your tenderness of heartAnd gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,Which we have noted in you to your kin,And egally indeed to all estates,--Yet whether you accept our suit or no,Your brother's son shall never reign our king;But we will plant some other in the throne,To the disgrace and downfall of your house:And in this resolution here we leave you.--Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.GLOUCESTERO, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.Exit BUCKINGHAM with the CitizensCATESBYCall them again, my lord, and accept their suit.ANOTHERDo, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.GLOUCESTERWould you enforce me to a world of care?Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,But penetrable to your. kind entreats,Albeit against my conscience and my soul.Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the restCousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,Since you will buckle fortune on my back,To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,I must have patience to endure the load:But if black scandal or foul-faced reproachAttend the sequel of your imposition,Your mere enforcement shall acquittance meFrom all the impure blots and stains thereof;For God he knows, and you may partly see,How far I am from the desire thereof.Lord MayorGod bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.GLOUCESTERIn saying so, you shall but say the truth.BUCKINGHAMThen I salute you with this kingly title:Long live Richard, England's royal king!Lord MayorCitizensAmen.BUCKINGHAMTo-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?GLOUCESTEREven when you please, since you will have it so.BUCKINGHAMTo-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:And so most joyfully we take our leave.GLOUCESTERCome, let us to our holy task again.Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I.
