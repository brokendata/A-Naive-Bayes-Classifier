ACT IPROLOGUEI come no more to make you laugh: things now,That bear a weighty and a serious brow,Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,We now present. Those that can pity, hereMay, if they think it well, let fall a tear;The subject will deserve it. Such as giveTheir money out of hope they may believe,May here find truth too. Those that come to seeOnly a show or two, and so agreeThe play may pass, if they be still and willing,I'll undertake may see away their shillingRichly in two short hours. Only theyThat come to hear a merry bawdy play,A noise of targets, or to see a fellowIn a long motley coat guarded with yellow,Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,To rank our chosen truth with such a showAs fool and fight is, beside forfeitingOur own brains, and the opinion that we bring,To make that only true we now intend,Will leave us never an understanding friend.Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are knownThe first and happiest hearers of the town,Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye seeThe very persons of our noble storyAs they were living; think you see them great,And follow'd with the general throng and sweatOf thousand friends; then in a moment, seeHow soon this mightiness meets misery:And, if you can be merry then, I'll sayA man may weep upon his wedding-day.SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNYBUCKINGHAMGood morrow, and well met. How have ye doneSince last we saw in France?NORFOLKI thank your grace,Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirerOf what I saw there.BUCKINGHAMAn untimely agueStay'd me a prisoner in my chamber whenThose suns of glory, those two lights of men,Met in the vale of Andren.NORFOLK'Twixt Guynes and Arde:I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clungIn their embracement, as they grew together;Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'dSuch a compounded one?BUCKINGHAMAll the whole timeI was my chamber's prisoner.NORFOLKThen you lostThe view of earthly glory: men might say,Till this time pomp was single, but now marriedTo one above itself. Each following dayBecame the next day's master, till the lastMade former wonders its. To-day the French,All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, theyMade Britain India: every man that stoodShow'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages wereAs cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bearThe pride upon them, that their very labourWas to them as a painting: now this masqueWas cried incomparable; and the ensuing nightMade it a fool and beggar. The two kings,Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,As presence did present them; him in eye,Still him in praise: and, being present both'Twas said they saw but one; and no discernerDurst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challengedThe noble spirits to arms, they did performBeyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,Being now seen possible enough, got credit,That Bevis was believed.BUCKINGHAMO, you go far.NORFOLKAs I belong to worship and affectIn honour honesty, the tract of every thingWould by a good discourser lose some life,Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.Order gave each thing view; the office didDistinctly his full function.BUCKINGHAMWho did guide,I mean, who set the body and the limbsOf this great sport together, as you guess?NORFOLKOne, certes, that promises no elementIn such a business.BUCKINGHAMI pray you, who, my lord?NORFOLKAll this was order'd by the good discretionOf the right reverend Cardinal of York.BUCKINGHAMThe devil speed him! no man's pie is freedFrom his ambitious finger. What had heTo do in these fierce vanities? I wonderThat such a keech can with his very bulkTake up the rays o' the beneficial sunAnd keep it from the earth.NORFOLKSurely, sir,There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose graceChalks successors their way, nor call'd uponFor high feats done to the crown; neither alliedFor eminent assistants; but, spider-like,Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,The force of his own merit makes his wayA gift that heaven gives for him, which buysA place next to the king.ABERGAVENNYI cannot tellWhat heaven hath given him,--let some graver eyePierce into that; but I can see his pridePeep through each part of him: whence has he that,If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,Or has given all before, and he beginsA new hell in himself.BUCKINGHAMWhy the devil,Upon this French going out, took he upon him,Without the privity o' the king, to appointWho should attend on him? He makes up the fileOf all the gentry; for the most part suchTo whom as great a charge as little honourHe meant to lay upon: and his own letter,The honourable board of council out,Must fetch him in the papers.ABERGAVENNYI do knowKinsmen of mine, three at the least, that haveBy this so sickened their estates, that neverThey shall abound as formerly.BUCKINGHAMO, manyHave broke their backs with laying manors on 'emFor this great journey. What did this vanityBut minister communication ofA most poor issue?NORFOLKGrievingly I think,The peace between the French and us not valuesThe cost that did conclude it.BUCKINGHAMEvery man,After the hideous storm that follow'd, wasA thing inspired; and, not consulting, brokeInto a general prophecy; That this tempest,Dashing the garment of this peace, abodedThe sudden breach on't.NORFOLKWhich is budded out;For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'dOur merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.ABERGAVENNYIs it thereforeThe ambassador is silenced?NORFOLKMarry, is't.ABERGAVENNYA proper title of a peace; and purchasedAt a superfluous rate!BUCKINGHAMWhy, all this businessOur reverend cardinal carried.NORFOLKLike it your grace,The state takes notice of the private differenceBetwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--And take it from a heart that wishes towards youHonour and plenteous safety--that you readThe cardinal's malice and his potencyTogether; to consider further thatWhat his high hatred would effect wants notA minister in his power. You know his nature,That he's revengeful, and I know his swordHath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rockThat I advise your shunning.Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,  certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdainCARDINAL WOLSEYThe Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?Where's his examination?First SecretaryHere, so please you.CARDINAL WOLSEYIs he in person ready?First SecretaryAy, please your grace.CARDINAL WOLSEYWell, we shall then know more; and BuckinghamShall lessen this big look.Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his TrainBUCKINGHAMThis butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and IHave not the power to muzzle him; therefore bestNot wake him in his slumber. A beggar's bookOutworths a noble's blood.NORFOLKWhat, are you chafed?Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance onlyWhich your disease requires.BUCKINGHAMI read in's looksMatter against me; and his eye reviledMe, as his abject object: at this instantHe bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;I'll follow and outstare him.NORFOLKStay, my lord,And let your reason with your choler questionWhat 'tis you go about: to climb steep hillsRequires slow pace at first: anger is likeA full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in EnglandCan advise me like you: be to yourselfAs you would to your friend.BUCKINGHAMI'll to the king;And from a mouth of honour quite cry downThis Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaimThere's difference in no persons.NORFOLKBe advised;Heat not a furnace for your foe so hotThat it do singe yourself: we may outrun,By violent swiftness, that which we run at,And lose by over-running. Know you not,The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:I say again, there is no English soulMore stronger to direct you than yourself,If with the sap of reason you would quench,Or but allay, the fire of passion.BUCKINGHAMSir,I am thankful to you; and I'll go alongBy your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,Whom from the flow of gall I name not butFrom sincere motions, by intelligence,And proofs as clear as founts in July whenWe see each grain of gravel, I do knowTo be corrupt and treasonous.NORFOLKSay not 'treasonous.'BUCKINGHAMTo the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strongAs shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenousAs he is subtle, and as prone to mischiefAs able to perform't; his mind and placeInfecting one another, yea, reciprocally--Only to show his pomp as well in FranceAs here at home, suggests the king our masterTo this last costly treaty, the interview,That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glassDid break i' the rinsing.NORFOLKFaith, and so it did.BUCKINGHAMPray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinalThe articles o' the combination drewAs himself pleased; and they were ratifiedAs he cried 'Thus let be': to as much endAs give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinalHas done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppyTo the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--For 'twas indeed his colour, but he cameTo whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:His fears were, that the interview betwixtEngland and France might, through their amity,Breed him some prejudice; for from this leaguePeep'd harms that menaced him: he privilyDeals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--Which I do well; for I am sure the emperorPaid ere he promised; whereby his suit was grantedEre it was ask'd; but when the way was made,And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,That he would please to alter the king's course,And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinalDoes buy and sell his honour as he pleases,And for his own advantage.NORFOLKI am sorryTo hear this of him; and could wish he wereSomething mistaken in't.BUCKINGHAMNo, not a syllable:I  do pronounce him in that very shapeHe shall appear in proof.Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the GuardBRANDONYour office, sergeant; execute it.SergeantSir,My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and EarlOf Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, IArrest thee of high treason, in the nameOf our most sovereign king.BUCKINGHAMLo, you, my lord,The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perishUnder device and practise.BRANDONI am sorryTo see you ta'en from liberty, to look onThe business present: 'tis his highness' pleasureYou shall to the Tower.BUCKINGHAMIt will help me nothingTo plead mine innocence; for that dye is on meWhich makes my whitest part black. The will of heavenBe done in this and all things! I obey.O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!BRANDONNay, he must bear you company. The kingTo ABERGAVENNYIs pleased you shall to the Tower, till you knowHow he determines further.ABERGAVENNYAs the duke said,The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasureBy me obey'd!BRANDONHere is a warrant fromThe king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodiesOf the duke's confessor, John de la Car,One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--BUCKINGHAMSo, so;These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.BRANDONA monk o' the Chartreux.BUCKINGHAMO, Nicholas Hopkins?BRANDONHe.BUCKINGHAMMy surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinalHath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.ExeuntSCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on  CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL;  CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right sideKING HENRY VIIIMy life itself, and the best heart of it,Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the levelOf a full-charged confederacy, and give thanksTo you that choked it. Let be call'd before usThat gentleman of Buckingham's; in personI'll hear him his confessions justify;And point by point the treasons of his masterHe shall again relate.A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter  QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK:  she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by himQUEEN KATHARINENay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.KING HENRY VIIIArise, and take place by us: half your suitNever name to us; you have half our power:The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;Repeat your will and take it.QUEEN KATHARINEThank your majesty.That you would love yourself, and in that loveNot unconsider'd leave your honour, norThe dignity of your office, is the pointOf my petition.KING HENRY VIIILady mine, proceed.QUEEN KATHARINEI am solicited, not by a few,And those of true condition, that your subjectsAre in great grievance: there have been commissionsSent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heartOf all their loyalties: wherein, although,My good lord cardinal, they vent reproachesMost bitterly on you, as putter onOf these exactions, yet the king our master--Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even heescapes notLanguage unmannerly, yea, such which breaksThe sides of loyalty, and almost appearsIn loud rebellion.NORFOLKNot almost appears,It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,The clothiers all, not able to maintainThe many to them longing, have put offThe spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,Unfit for other life, compell'd by hungerAnd lack of other means, in desperate mannerDaring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,And danger serves among then!KING HENRY VIIITaxation!Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,You that are blamed for it alike with us,Know you of this taxation?CARDINAL WOLSEYPlease you, sir,I know but of a single part, in aughtPertains to the state; and front but in that fileWhere others tell steps with me.QUEEN KATHARINENo, my lord,You know no more than others; but you frameThings that are known alike; which are not wholesomeTo those which would not know them, and yet mustPerforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,Whereof my sovereign would have note, they areMost pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,The back is sacrifice to the load. They sayThey are devised by you; or else you sufferToo hard an exclamation.KING HENRY VIIIStill exaction!The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,Is this exaction?QUEEN KATHARINEI am much too venturousIn tempting of your patience; but am bolden'dUnder your promised pardon. The subjects' griefComes through commissions, which compel from eachThe sixth part of his substance, to be leviedWithout delay; and the pretence for thisIs named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freezeAllegiance in them; their curses nowLive where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,This tractable obedience is a slaveTo each incensed will. I would your highnessWould give it quick consideration, forThere is no primer business.KING HENRY VIIIBy my life,This is against our pleasure.CARDINAL WOLSEYAnd for me,I have no further gone in this than byA single voice; and that not pass'd me butBy learned approbation of the judges. If I amTraduced by ignorant tongues, which neither knowMy faculties nor person, yet will beThe chronicles of my doing, let me say'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brakeThat virtue must go through. We must not stintOur necessary actions, in the fearTo cope malicious censurers; which ever,As ravenous fishes, do a vessel followThat is new-trimm'd, but benefit no furtherThan vainly longing. What we oft do best,By sick interpreters, once weak ones, isNot ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,Hitting a grosser quality, is cried upFor our best act. If we shall stand still,In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,We should take root here where we sit, or sitState-statues only.KING HENRY VIIIThings done well,And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;Things done without example, in their issueAre to be fear'd. Have you a precedentOf this commission? I believe, not any.We must not rend our subjects from our laws,And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?A trembling contribution! Why, we takeFrom every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,The air will drink the sap. To every countyWhere this is question'd send our letters, withFree pardon to each man that has deniedThe force of this commission: pray, look to't;I put it to your care.CARDINAL WOLSEYA word with you.To the SecretaryLet there be letters writ to every shire,Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commonsHardly conceive of me; let it be noisedThat through our intercession this revokementAnd pardon comes: I shall anon advise youFurther in the proceeding.Exit SecretaryEnter SurveyorQUEEN KATHARINEI am sorry that the Duke of BuckinghamIs run in your displeasure.KING HENRY VIIIIt grieves many:The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;To nature none more bound; his training such,That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,When these so noble benefits shall proveNot well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,They turn to vicious forms, ten times more uglyThan ever they were fair. This man so complete,Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,Almost with ravish'd listening, could not findHis hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,Hath into monstrous habits put the gracesThat once were his, and is become as blackAs if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--This was his gentleman in trust--of himThings to strike honour sad. Bid him recountThe fore-recited practises; whereofWe cannot feel too little, hear too much.CARDINAL WOLSEYStand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,Most like a careful subject, have collectedOut of the Duke of Buckingham.KING HENRY VIIISpeak freely.SurveyorFirst, it was usual with him, every dayIt would infect his speech, that if the kingShould without issue die, he'll carry it soTo make the sceptre his: these very wordsI've heard him utter to his son-in-law,Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menacedRevenge upon the cardinal.CARDINAL WOLSEYPlease your highness, noteThis dangerous conception in this point.Not friended by by his wish, to your high personHis will is most malignant; and it stretchesBeyond you, to your friends.QUEEN KATHARINEMy learn'd lord cardinal,Deliver all with charity.KING HENRY VIIISpeak on:How grounded he his title to the crown,Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard himAt any time speak aught?SurveyorHe was brought to thisBy a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.KING HENRY VIIIWhat was that Hopkins?SurveyorSir, a Chartreux friar,His confessor, who fed him every minuteWith words of sovereignty.KING HENRY VIIIHow know'st thou this?SurveyorNot long before your highness sped to France,The duke being at the Rose, within the parishSaint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demandWhat was the speech among the LondonersConcerning the French journey: I replied,Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,To the king's danger. Presently the dukeSaid, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted'Twould prove the verity of certain wordsSpoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permitJohn de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hourTo hear from him a matter of some moment:Whom after under the confession's sealHe solemnly had sworn, that what he spokeMy chaplain to no creature living, butTo me, should utter, with demure confidenceThis pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him striveTo gain the love o' the commonalty: the dukeShall govern England.'QUEEN KATHARINEIf I know you well,You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your officeOn the complaint o' the tenants: take good heedYou charge not in your spleen a noble personAnd spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;Yes, heartily beseech you.KING HENRY VIIILet him on.Go forward.SurveyorOn my soul, I'll speak but truth.I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusionsThe monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for himTo ruminate on this so far, untilIt forged him some design, which, being believed,It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,It can do me no damage;' adding further,That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's headsShould have gone off.KING HENRY VIIIHa! what, so rank? Ah ha!There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?SurveyorI can, my liege.KING HENRY VIIIProceed.SurveyorBeing at Greenwich,After your highness had reproved the dukeAbout Sir William Blomer,--KING HENRY VIIII rememberOf such a time: being my sworn servant,The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?Surveyor'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'dThe part my father meant to act uponThe usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,As he made semblance of his duty, wouldHave put his knife to him.'KING HENRY VIIIA giant traitor!CARDINAL WOLSEYNow, madam, may his highness live in freedom,and this man out of prison?QUEEN KATHARINEGod mend all!KING HENRY VIIIThere's something more would out of thee; what say'st?SurveyorAfter 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyesHe did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenorWas,--were he evil used, he would outgoHis father by as much as a performanceDoes an irresolute purpose.KING HENRY VIIIThere's his period,To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;Call him to present trial: if he mayFind mercy in the law, 'tis his: if none,Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,He's traitor to the height.ExeuntSCENE III. An ante-chamber in the palace.Enter Chamberlain and SANDSChamberlainIs't possible the spells of France should juggleMen into such strange mysteries?SANDSNew customs,Though they be never so ridiculous,Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.ChamberlainAs far as I see, all the good our EnglishHave got by the late voyage is but merelyA fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;For when they hold 'em, you would swear directlyTheir very noses had been counsellorsTo Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.SANDSThey have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,That never saw 'em pace before, the spavinOr springhalt reign'd among 'em.ChamberlainDeath! my lord,Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.Enter LOVELLHow now!What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?LOVELLFaith, my lord,I hear of none, but the new proclamationThat's clapp'd upon the court-gate.ChamberlainWhat is't for?LOVELLThe reformation of our travell'd gallants,That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.ChamberlainI'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieursTo think an English courtier may be wise,And never see the Louvre.LOVELLThey must either,For so run the conditions, leave those remnantsOf fool and feather that they got in France,With all their honourable point of ignorancePertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,Abusing better men than they can be,Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing cleanThe faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,And understand again like honest men;Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear awayThe lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.SANDS'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseasesAre grown so catching.ChamberlainWhat a loss our ladiesWill have of these trim vanities!LOVELLAy, marry,There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresonsHave got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.SANDSThe devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: nowAn honest country lord, as I am, beatenA long time out of play, may bring his plainsongAnd have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,Held current music too.ChamberlainWell said, Lord Sands;Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.SANDSNo, my lord;Nor shall not, while I have a stump.ChamberlainSir Thomas,Whither were you a-going?LOVELLTo the cardinal's:Your lordship is a guest too.ChamberlainO, 'tis true:This night he makes a supper, and a great one,To many lords and ladies; there will beThe beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.LOVELLThat churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;His dews fall every where.ChamberlainNo doubt he's noble;He had a black mouth that said other of him.SANDSHe may, my lord; has wherewithal: in himSparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:Men of his way should be most liberal;They are set here for examples.ChamberlainTrue, they are so:But few now give so great ones.

All's now done, but the ceremonyOf bringing back the prisoner.Second GentlemanWere you there?First GentlemanYes, indeed, was I.Second GentlemanPray, speak what has happen'd.First GentlemanYou may guess quickly what.Second GentlemanIs he found guilty?First GentlemanYes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.Second GentlemanI am sorry for't.First GentlemanSo are a number more.Second GentlemanBut, pray, how pass'd it?First GentlemanI'll tell you in a little. The great dukeCame to the bar; where to his accusationsHe pleaded still not guilty and allegedMany sharp reasons to defeat the law.The king's attorney on the contraryUrged on the examinations, proofs, confessionsOf divers witnesses; which the duke desiredTo have brought viva voce to his face:At which appear'd against him his surveyor;Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,Hopkins, that made this mischief.Second GentlemanThat was heThat fed him with his prophecies?First GentlemanThe same.All these accused him strongly; which he fainWould have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:And so his peers, upon this evidence,Have found him guilty of high treason. MuchHe spoke, and learnedly, for life; but allWas either pitied in him or forgotten.Second GentlemanAfter all this, how did he bear himself?First GentlemanWhen he was brought again to the bar, to hearHis knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'dWith such an agony, he sweat extremely,And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:But he fell to himself again, and sweetlyIn all the rest show'd a most noble patience.Second GentlemanI do not think he fears death.First GentlemanSure, he does not:He never was so womanish; the causeHe may a little grieve at.Second GentlemanCertainlyThe cardinal is the end of this.First Gentleman'Tis likely,By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,Lest he should help his father.Second GentlemanThat trick of stateWas a deep envious one.First GentlemanAt his returnNo doubt he will requite it. This is noted,And generally, whoever the king favours,The cardinal instantly will find employment,And far enough from court too.Second GentlemanAll the commonsHate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as muchThey love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,The mirror of all courtesy;--First GentlemanStay there, sir,And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves  before him; the axe with the edge towards him;  halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL, VAUX, SANDS, and common peopleSecond GentlemanLet's stand close, and behold him.BUCKINGHAMAll good people,You that thus far have come to pity me,Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.I have this day received a traitor's judgment,And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,And if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!The law I bear no malice for my death;'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.For further life in this world I ne'er hope,Nor will I sue, although the king have merciesMore than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,His noble friends and fellows, whom to leaveIs only bitter to him, only dying,Go with me, like good angels, to my end;And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.LOVELLI do beseech your grace, for charity,If ever any malice in your heartWere hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.BUCKINGHAMSir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive youAs I would be forgiven: I forgive all;There cannot be those numberless offences'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:no black envyShall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell himYou met him half in heaven: my vows and prayersYet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,Shall cry for blessings on him: may he liveLonger than I have time to tell his years!Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!And when old time shall lead him to his end,Goodness and he fill up one monument!LOVELLTo the water side I must conduct your grace;Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,Who undertakes you to your end.VAUXPrepare there,The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;And fit it with such furniture as suitsThe greatness of his person.BUCKINGHAMNay, Sir Nicholas,Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.When I came hither, I was lord high constableAnd Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:Yet I am richer than my base accusers,That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,Who first raised head against usurping Richard,Flying for succor to his servant Banister,Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pityingMy father's loss, like a most royal prince,Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,Made my name once more noble. Now his son,Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and allThat made me happy at one stroke has takenFor ever from the world. I had my trial,And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,A little happier than my wretched father:Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: bothFell by our servants, by those men we loved most;A most unnatural and faithless service!Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,This from a dying man receive as certain:Where you are liberal of your loves and counselsBe sure you be not loose; for those you make friendsAnd give your hearts to, when they once perceiveThe least rub in your fortunes, fall awayLike water from ye, never found againBut where they mean to sink ye. All good people,Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hourOf my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:And when you would say something that is sad,Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and TrainFirst GentlemanO, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,I fear, too many curses on their beadsThat were the authors.Second GentlemanIf the duke be guiltless,'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inklingOf an ensuing evil, if it fall,Greater than this.First GentlemanGood angels keep it from us!What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?Second GentlemanThis secret is so weighty, 'twill requireA strong faith to conceal it.First GentlemanLet me have it;I do not talk much.Second GentlemanI am confident,You shall, sir: did you not of late days hearA buzzing of a separationBetween the king and Katharine?First GentlemanYes, but it held not:For when the king once heard it, out of angerHe sent command to the lord mayor straightTo stop the rumor, and allay those tonguesThat durst disperse it.Second GentlemanBut that slander, sir,Is found a truth now: for it grows againFresher than e'er it was; and held for certainThe king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,Or some about him near, have, out of maliceTo the good queen, possess'd him with a scrupleThat will undo her: to confirm this too,Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;As all think, for this business.First Gentleman'Tis the cardinal;And merely to revenge him on the emperorFor not bestowing on him, at his asking,The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.Second GentlemanI think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruelThat she should feel the smart of this? The cardinalWill have his will, and she must fall.First Gentleman'Tis woful.We are too open here to argue this;Let's think in private more.ExeuntSCENE II. An ante-chamber in the palace.Enter Chamberlain, reading a letterChamberlain'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, withall the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, andfurnished. They were young and handsome, and of thebest breed in the north. When they were ready toset out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, bycommission and main power, took 'em from me; withthis reason: His master would be served before asubject, if not before the king; which stopped ourmouths, sir.'I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:He will have all, I think.Enter, to Chamberlain, NORFOLK and SUFFOLKNORFOLKWell met, my lord chamberlain.ChamberlainGood day to both your graces.SUFFOLKHow is the king employ'd?ChamberlainI left him private,Full of sad thoughts and troubles.NORFOLKWhat's the cause?ChamberlainIt seems the marriage with his brother's wifeHas crept too near his conscience.SUFFOLKNo, his conscienceHas crept too near another lady.NORFOLK'Tis so:This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.SUFFOLKPray God he do! he'll never know himself else.NORFOLKHow holily he works in all his business!And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the leagueBetween us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,He dives into the king's soul, and there scattersDangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:And out of all these to restore the king,He counsels a divorce; a loss of herThat, like a jewel, has hung twenty yearsAbout his neck, yet never lost her lustre;Of her that loves him with that excellenceThat angels love good men with; even of herThat, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?ChamberlainHeaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most trueThese news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,And every true heart weeps for't: all that dareLook into these affairs see this main end,The French king's sister. Heaven will one day openThe king's eyes, that so long have slept uponThis bold bad man.SUFFOLKAnd free us from his slavery.NORFOLKWe had need pray,And heartily, for our deliverance;Or this imperious man will work us allFrom princes into pages: all men's honoursLie like one lump before him, to be fashion'dInto what pitch he please.SUFFOLKFor me, my lords,I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:As I am made without him, so I'll stand,If the king please; his curses and his blessingsTouch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.I knew him, and I know him; so I leave himTo him that made him proud, the pope.NORFOLKLet's in;And with some other business put the kingFrom these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:My lord, you'll bear us company?ChamberlainExcuse me;The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:Health to your lordships.NORFOLKThanks, my good lord chamberlain.Exit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain, and sits reading pensivelySUFFOLKHow sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.KING HENRY VIIIWho's there, ha?NORFOLKPray God he be not angry.KING HENRY VIIIWho's there, I say?

He was a fool;For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,If I command him, follows my appointment:I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.KING HENRY VIIIDeliver this with modesty to the queen.Exit GARDINERThe most convenient place that I can think ofFor such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;There ye shall meet about this weighty business.My Wolsey, see it furnish'd.

Alas, sir,In what have I offended you? what causeHath my behavior given to your displeasure,That thus you should proceed to put me off,And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,I have been to you a true and humble wife,At all times to your will conformable;Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorryAs I saw it inclined: when was the hourI ever contradicted your desire,Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friendsHave I not strove to love, although I knewHe were mine enemy? what friend of mineThat had to him derived your anger, did IContinue in my liking? nay, gave noticeHe was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mindThat I have been your wife, in this obedience,Upward of twenty years, and have been blestWith many children by you: if, in the courseAnd process of this time, you can report,And prove it too, against mine honour aught,My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,Against your sacred person, in God's name,Turn me away; and let the foul'st contemptShut door upon me, and so give me upTo the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,The king, your father, was reputed forA prince most prudent, of an excellentAnd unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd oneThe wisest prince that there had reign'd by manyA year before: it is not to be question'dThat they had gather'd a wise council to themOf every realm, that did debate this business,Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humblyBeseech you, sir, to spare me, till I mayBe by my friends in Spain advised; whose counselI will implore: if not, i' the name of God,Your pleasure be fulfill'd!CARDINAL WOLSEYYou have here, lady,And of your choice, these reverend fathers; menOf singular integrity and learning,Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembledTo plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootlessThat longer you desire the court; as wellFor your own quiet, as to rectifyWhat is unsettled in the king.CARDINAL CAMPEIUSHis graceHath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,It's fit this royal session do proceed;And that, without delay, their argumentsBe now produced and heard.QUEEN KATHARINELord cardinal,To you I speak.CARDINAL WOLSEYYour pleasure, madam?QUEEN KATHARINESir,I am about to weep; but, thinking thatWe are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certainThe daughter of a king, my drops of tearsI'll turn to sparks of fire.CARDINAL WOLSEYBe patient yet.QUEEN KATHARINEI will, when you are humble; nay, before,Or God will punish me. I do believe,Induced by potent circumstances, thatYou are mine enemy, and make my challengeYou shall not be my judge: for it is youHave blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,I utterly abhor, yea, from my soulRefuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,I hold my most malicious foe, and think notAt all a friend to truth.CARDINAL WOLSEYI do professYou speak not like yourself; who ever yetHave stood to charity, and display'd the effectsOf disposition gentle, and of wisdomO'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:I have no spleen against you; nor injusticeFor you or any: how far I have proceeded,Or how far further shall, is warrantedBy a commission from the consistory,Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge meThat I have blown this coal: I do deny it:The king is present: if it be known to himThat I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as muchAs you have done my truth. If he knowThat I am free of your report, he knowsI am not of your wrong. Therefore in himIt lies to cure me: and the cure is, toRemove these thoughts from you: the which beforeHis highness shall speak in, I do beseechYou, gracious madam, to unthink your speakingAnd to say so no more.QUEEN KATHARINEMy lord, my lord,I am a simple woman, much too weakTo oppose your cunning. You're meek andhumble-mouth'd;You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,With meekness and humility; but your heartIs cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mountedWhere powers are your retainers, and your words,Domestics to you, serve your will as't pleaseYourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,You tender more your person's honour thanYour high profession spiritual: that againI do refuse you for my judge; and here,Before you all, appeal unto the pope,To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,And to be judged by him.She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII, and offers to departCARDINAL CAMPEIUSThe queen is obstinate,Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, andDisdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.She's going away.KING HENRY VIIICall her again.CrierKatharine Queen of England, come into the court.GRIFFITHMadam, you are call'd back.QUEEN KATHARINEWhat need you note it? pray you, keep your way:When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:I will not tarry; no, nor ever moreUpon this business my appearance makeIn any of their courts.Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her AttendantsKING HENRY VIIIGo thy ways, Kate:That man i' the world who shall report he hasA better wife, let him in nought be trusted,For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,Obeying in commanding, and thy partsSovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;And, like her true nobility, she hasCarried herself towards me.CARDINAL WOLSEYMost gracious sir,In humblest manner I require your highness,That it shall please you to declare, in hearingOf all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,There must I be unloosed, although not thereAt once and fully satisfied,--whether ever IDid broach this business to your highness; orLaid any scruple in your way, which mightInduce you to the question on't? or everHave to you, but with thanks to God for suchA royal lady, spake one the least word that mightBe to the prejudice of her present state,Or touch of her good person?KING HENRY VIIIMy lord cardinal,I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,I free you from't. You are not to be taughtThat you have many enemies, that know notWhy they are so, but, like to village-curs,Bark when their fellows do: by some of theseThe queen is put in anger. You're excused:But will you be more justified? You everHave wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desiredIt to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,The passages made toward it: on my honour,I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,I will be bold with time and your attention:Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:My conscience first received a tenderness,Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'dBy the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;Who had been hither sent on the debatingA marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans andOur daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,Ere a determinate resolution, he,I mean the bishop, did require a respite;Wherein he might the king his lord advertiseWhether our daughter were legitimate,Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shookThe bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,Yea, with a splitting power, and made to trembleThe region of my breast; which forced such way,That many mazed considerings did throngAnd press'd in with this caution. First, methoughtI stood not in the smile of heaven; who hadCommanded nature, that my lady's womb,If it conceived a male child by me, shouldDo no more offices of life to't thanThe grave does to the dead; for her male issueOr died where they were made, or shortly afterThis world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should notBe gladded in't by me: then follows, thatI weigh'd the danger which my realms stood inBy this my issue's fail; and that gave to meMany a groaning throe. Thus hulling inThe wild sea of my conscience, I did steerToward this remedy, whereupon we areNow present here together: that's to say,I meant to rectify my conscience,--whichI then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--By all the reverend fathers of the landAnd doctors learn'd: first I began in privateWith you, my Lord of Lincoln; you rememberHow under my oppression I did reek,When I first moved you.LINCOLNVery well, my liege.KING HENRY VIIII have spoke long: be pleased yourself to sayHow far you satisfied me.LINCOLNSo please your highness,The question did at first so stagger me,Bearing a state of mighty moment in'tAnd consequence of dread, that I committedThe daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;And did entreat your highness to this courseWhich you are running here.KING HENRY VIIII then moved you,My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leaveTo make this present summons: unsolicitedI left no reverend person in this court;But by particular consent proceededUnder your hands and seals: therefore, go on:For no dislike i' the world against the personOf the good queen, but the sharp thorny pointsOf my alleged reasons, drive this forward:Prove but our marriage lawful, by my lifeAnd kingly dignity, we are contentedTo wear our mortal state to come with her,Katharine our queen, before the primest creatureThat's paragon'd o' the world.CARDINAL CAMPEIUSSo please your highness,The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitnessThat we adjourn this court till further day:Meanwhile must be an earnest motionMade to the queen, to call back her appealShe intends unto his holiness.KING HENRY VIII[Aside]	I may perceiveThese cardinals trifle with me: I abhorThis dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,My comfort comes along. Break up the court:I say, set on.Exeunt in manner as they enteredACT IIISCENE I. London.

Now I think on't,They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:But all hoods make not monks.Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUSCARDINAL WOLSEYPeace to your highness!QUEEN KATHARINEYour graces find me here part of a housewife,I would be all, against the worst may happen.What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?CARDINAL WOLSEYMay it please you noble madam, to withdrawInto your private chamber, we shall give youThe full cause of our coming.QUEEN KATHARINESpeak it here:There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,Deserves a corner: would all other womenCould speak this with as free a soul as I do!My lords, I care not, so much I am happyAbove a number, if my actionsWere tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,Envy and base opinion set against 'em,I know my life so even. If your businessSeek me out, and that way I am wife in,Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.CARDINAL WOLSEYTanta est erga te mentis integritas, reginaserenissima,--QUEEN KATHARINEO, good my lord, no Latin;I am not such a truant since my coming,As not to know the language I have lived in:A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,suspicious;Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,The willing'st sin I ever yet committedMay be absolved in English.CARDINAL WOLSEYNoble lady,I am sorry my integrity should breed,And service to his majesty and you,So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.We come not by the way of accusation,To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,You have too much, good lady; but to knowHow you stand minded in the weighty differenceBetween the king and you; and to deliver,Like free and honest men, our just opinionsAnd comforts to your cause.CARDINAL CAMPEIUSMost honour'd madam,My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,Forgetting, like a good man your late censureBoth of his truth and him, which was too far,Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,His service and his counsel.QUEEN KATHARINE[Aside]	To betray me.--My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!But how to make ye suddenly an answer,In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,And to such men of gravity and learning,In truth, I know not. I was set at workAmong my maids: full little, God knows, lookingEither for such men or such business.For her sake that I have been,--for I feelThe last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,Let me have time and counsel for my cause:Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!CARDINAL WOLSEYMadam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:Your hopes and friends are infinite.QUEEN KATHARINEIn EnglandBut little for my profit: can you think, lords,That any Englishman dare give me counsel?Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,They that must weigh out my afflictions,They that my trust must grow to, live not here:They are, as all my other comforts, far henceIn mine own country, lords.CARDINAL CAMPEIUSI would your graceWould leave your griefs, and take my counsel.QUEEN KATHARINEHow, sir?CARDINAL CAMPEIUSPut your main cause into the king's protection;He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be muchBoth for your honour better and your cause;For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,You'll part away disgraced.CARDINAL WOLSEYHe tells you rightly.QUEEN KATHARINEYe tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judgeThat no king can corrupt.CARDINAL CAMPEIUSYour rage mistakes us.QUEEN KATHARINEThe more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?I will not wish ye half my miseries;I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at onceThe burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.CARDINAL WOLSEYMadam, this is a mere distraction;You turn the good we offer into envy.QUEEN KATHARINEYe turn me into nothing: woe upon yeAnd all such false professors! would you have me--If you have any justice, any pity;If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,And all the fellowship I hold now with himIs only my obedience. What can happenTo me above this wretchedness? all your studiesMake me a curse like this.CARDINAL CAMPEIUSYour fears are worse.QUEEN KATHARINEHave I lived thus long--let me speak myself,Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,Never yet branded with suspicion?Have I with all my full affectionsStill met the king? loved him next heaven?obey'd him?Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?Almost forgot my prayers to content him?And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.Bring me a constant woman to her husband,One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;And to that woman, when she has done most,Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.CARDINAL WOLSEYMadam, you wander from the good we aim at.QUEEN KATHARINEMy lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,To give up willingly that noble titleYour master wed me to: nothing but deathShall e'er divorce my dignities.CARDINAL WOLSEYPray, hear me.QUEEN KATHARINEWould I had never trod this English earth,Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.What will become of me now, wretched lady!I am the most unhappy woman living.Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,I'll hang my head and perish.CARDINAL WOLSEYIf your graceCould but be brought to know our ends are honest,You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,The way of our profession is against it:We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.For goodness' sake, consider what you do;How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterlyGrow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.The hearts of princes kiss obedience,So much they love it; but to stubborn spiritsThey swell, and grow as terrible as storms.I know you have a gentle, noble temper,A soul as even as a calm: pray, think usThose we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.CARDINAL CAMPEIUSMadam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtuesWith these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,As yours was put into you, ever castsSuch doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;Beware you lose it not: for us, if you pleaseTo trust us in your business, we are readyTo use our utmost  studies in your service.QUEEN KATHARINEDo what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,If I have used myself unmannerly;You know I am a woman, lacking witTo make a seemly answer to such persons.Pray, do my service to his majesty:He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayersWhile I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,That little thought, when she set footing here,She should have bought her dignities so dear.ExeuntSCENE II.

What though I know her virtuousAnd well deserving? yet I know her forA spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome toOur cause, that she should lie i' the bosom ofOur hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung upAn heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; oneHath crawl'd into the favour of the king,And is his oracle.NORFOLKHe is vex'd at something.SURREYI would 'twere something that would fret the string,The master-cord on's heart!Enter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELLSUFFOLKThe king, the king!KING HENRY VIIIWhat piles of wealth hath he accumulatedTo his own portion! and what expense by the hourSeems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,Saw you the cardinal?NORFOLKMy lord, we haveStood here observing him: some strange commotionIs in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,Then lays his finger on his temple, straightSprings out into fast gait; then stops again,Strikes his breast hard, and anon he castsHis eye against the moon: in most strange posturesWe have seen him set himself.KING HENRY VIIIIt may well be;There is a mutiny in's mind. This morningPapers of state he sent me to peruse,As I required: and wot you what I foundThere,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; whichI find at such proud rate, that it out-speaksPossession of a subject.NORFOLKIt's heaven's will:Some spirit put this paper in the packet,To bless your eye withal.KING HENRY VIIIIf we did thinkHis contemplation were above the earth,And fix'd on spiritual object, he should stillDwell in his musings: but I am afraidHis thinkings are below the moon, not worthHis serious considering.King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL, who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEYCARDINAL WOLSEYHeaven forgive me!Ever God bless your highness!KING HENRY VIIIGood my lord,You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventoryOf your best graces in your mind; the whichYou were now running o'er: you have scarce timeTo steal from spiritual leisure a brief spanTo keep your earthly audit: sure, in thatI deem you an ill husband, and am gladTo have you therein my companion.CARDINAL WOLSEYSir,For holy offices I have a time; a timeTo think upon the part of business whichI bear i' the state; and nature does requireHer times of preservation, which perforceI, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,Must give my tendence to.KING HENRY VIIIYou have said well.CARDINAL WOLSEYAnd ever may your highness yoke together,As I will lend you cause, my doing wellWith my well saying!KING HENRY VIII'Tis well said again;And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:His said he did; and with his deed did crownHis word upon you. Since I had my office,I have kept you next my heart; have not aloneEmploy'd you where high profits might come home,But pared my present havings, to bestowMy bounties upon you.CARDINAL WOLSEY[Aside]             What should this mean?SURREY[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!KING HENRY VIIIHave I not made you,The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,If what I now pronounce you have found true:And, if you may confess it, say withal,If you are bound to us or no. What say you?CARDINAL WOLSEYMy sovereign, I confess your royal graces,Shower'd on me daily, have been more than couldMy studied purposes requite; which wentBeyond all man's endeavours: my endeavoursHave ever come too short of my desires,Yet filed with my abilities: mine own endsHave been mine so that evermore they pointedTo the good of your most sacred person andThe profit of the state. For your great gracesHeap'd upon me, poor undeserver, ICan nothing render but allegiant thanks,My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,Which ever has and ever shall be growing,Till death, that winter, kill it.KING HENRY VIIIFairly answer'd;A loyal and obedient subject isTherein illustrated: the honour of itDoes pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,The foulness is the punishment. I presumeThat, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, moreOn you than any; so your hand and heart,Your brain, and every function of your power,Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,As 'twere in love's particular, be moreTo me, your friend, than any.CARDINAL WOLSEYI do professThat for your highness' good I ever labour'dMore than mine own; that am, have, and will be--Though all the world should crack their duty to you,And throw it from their soul; though perils didAbound, as thick as thought could make 'em, andAppear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,As doth a rock against the chiding flood,Should the approach of this wild river break,And stand unshaken yours.KING HENRY VIII'Tis nobly spoken:Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;Giving him papersAnd after, this: and then to breakfast withWhat appetite you have.Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY: the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whisperingCARDINAL WOLSEYWhat should this mean?What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?He parted frowning from me, as if ruinLeap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lionUpon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;This paper has undone me: 'tis the accountOf all that world of wealth I have drawn togetherFor mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devilMade me put this main secret in the packetI sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?No new device to beat this from his brains?I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I knowA way, if it take right, in spite of fortuneWill bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'The letter, as I live, with all the businessI writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;And, from that full meridian of my glory,I haste now to my setting: I shall fallLike a bright exhalation m the evening,And no man see me more.Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY, and the ChamberlainNORFOLKHear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands youTo render up the great seal presentlyInto our hands; and to confine yourselfTo Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,Till you hear further from his highness.CARDINAL WOLSEYStay:Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carryAuthority so weighty.SUFFOLKWho dare cross 'em,Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?CARDINAL WOLSEYTill I find more than will or words to do it,I mean your malice, know, officious lords,I dare and must deny it. Now I feelOf what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wantonYe appear in every thing may bring my ruin!Follow your envious courses, men of malice;You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,You ask with such a violence, the king,Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?SURREYThe king, that gave it.CARDINAL WOLSEYIt must be himself, then.SURREYThou art a proud traitor, priest.CARDINAL WOLSEYProud lord, thou liest:Within these forty hours Surrey durst betterHave burnt that tongue than said so.SURREYThy ambition,Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing landOf noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:The heads of all thy brother cardinals,With thee and all thy best parts bound together,Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!You sent me deputy for Ireland;Far from his succor, from the king, from allThat might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,Absolved him with an axe.CARDINAL WOLSEYThis, and all elseThis talking lord can lay upon my credit,I answer is most false. The duke by lawFound his deserts: how innocent I wasFrom any private malice in his end,His noble jury and foul cause can witness.If I loved many words, lord, I should tell youYou have as little honesty as honour,That in the way of loyalty and truthToward the king, my ever royal master,Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,And all that love his follies.SURREYBy my soul,Your long coat, priest, protects you; thoushouldst feelMy sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,And dare us with his cap like larks.CARDINAL WOLSEYAll goodnessIs poison to thy stomach.SURREYYes, that goodnessOf gleaning all the land's wealth into one,Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;The goodness of your intercepted packetsYou writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,As you respect the common good, the stateOf our despised nobility, our issues,Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articlesCollected from his life. I'll startle youWorse than the scaring bell, when the brown wenchLay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.CARDINAL WOLSEYHow much, methinks, I could despise this man,But that I am bound in charity against it!NORFOLKThose articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:But, thus much, they are foul ones.CARDINAL WOLSEYSo much fairerAnd spotless shall mine innocence arise,When the king knows my truth.SURREYThis cannot save you:I thank my memory, I yet rememberSome of these articles; and out they shall.Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,You'll show a little honesty.CARDINAL WOLSEYSpeak on, sir;I dare your worst objections: if I blush,It is to see a nobleman want manners.SURREYI had rather want those than my head. Have at you!First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,You wrought to be a legate; by which powerYou maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.NORFOLKThen, that in all you writ to Rome, or elseTo foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'Was still inscribed; in which you brought the kingTo be your servant.SUFFOLKThen that, without the knowledgeEither of king or council, when you wentAmbassador to the emperor, you made boldTo carry into Flanders the great seal.SURREYItem, you sent a large commissionTo Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,Without the king's will or the state's allowance,A league between his highness and Ferrara.SUFFOLKThat, out of mere ambition, you have causedYour holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.SURREYThen that you have sent innumerable substance--By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--To furnish Rome, and to prepare the waysYou have for dignities; to the mere undoingOf all the kingdom. Many more there are;Which, since they are of you, and odious,I will not taint my mouth with.ChamberlainO my lord,Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:His faults lie open to the laws; let them,Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see himSo little of his great self.SURREYI forgive him.SUFFOLKLord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,Because all those things you have done of late,By your power legatine, within this kingdom,Fall into the compass of a praemunire,That therefore such a writ be sued against you;To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,Chattels, and whatsoever, and to beOut of the king's protection. This is my charge.NORFOLKAnd so we'll leave you to your meditationsHow to live better. For your stubborn answerAbout the giving back the great seal to us,The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEYCARDINAL WOLSEYSo farewell to the little good you bear me.Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!This is the state of man: to-day he puts forthThe tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surelyHis greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,This many summers in a sea of glory,But far beyond my depth: my high-blown prideAt length broke under me and now has left me,Weary and old with service, to the mercyOf a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretchedIs that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,More pangs and fears than wars or women have:And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,Never to hope again.Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazedWhy, how now, Cromwell!CROMWELLI have no power to speak, sir.CARDINAL WOLSEYWhat, amazedAt my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonderA great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,I am fall'n indeed.CROMWELLHow does your grace?CARDINAL WOLSEYWhy, well;Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.I know myself now; and I feel within meA peace above all earthly dignities,A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, takenA load would sink a navy, too much honour:O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthenToo heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!CROMWELLI am glad your grace has made that right use of it.CARDINAL WOLSEYI hope I have: I am able now, methinks,Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,To endure more miseries and greater farThan my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.What news abroad?CROMWELLThe heaviest and the worstIs your displeasure with the king.CARDINAL WOLSEYGod bless him!CROMWELLThe next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosenLord chancellor in your place.CARDINAL WOLSEYThat's somewhat sudden:But he's a learned man. May he continueLong in his highness' favour, and do justiceFor truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?CROMWELLThat Cranmer is return'd with welcome,Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.CARDINAL WOLSEYThat's news indeed.CROMWELLLast, that the Lady Anne,Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,This day was view'd in open as his queen,Going to chapel; and the voice is nowOnly about her coronation.CARDINAL WOLSEYThere was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,The king has gone beyond me: all my gloriesIn that one woman I have lost for ever:No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,Or gild again the noble troops that waitedUpon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy nowTo be thy lord and master: seek the king;That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told himWhat and how true thou art: he will advance thee;Some little memory of me will stir him--I know his noble nature--not to letThy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,Neglect him not; make use now, and provideFor thine own future safety.CROMWELLO my lord,Must I, then, leave you? must I needs foregoSo good, so noble and so true a master?Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.The king shall have my service: but my prayersFor ever and for ever shall be yours.CARDINAL WOLSEYCromwell, I did not think to shed a tearIn all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mentionOf me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;Corruption wins not more than honesty.Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,O Cromwell,Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;And,--prithee, lead me in:There take an inventory of all I have,To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,And my integrity to heaven, is allI dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!Had I but served my God with half the zealI served my king, he would not in mine ageHave left me naked to mine enemies.CROMWELLGood sir, have patience.CARDINAL WOLSEYSo I have. FarewellThe hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. A street in Westminster.Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one anotherFirst GentlemanYou're well met once again.Second GentlemanSo are you.First GentlemanYou come to take your stand here, and beholdThe Lady Anne pass from her coronation?Second Gentleman'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.First Gentleman'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;This, general joy.Second Gentleman'Tis well: the citizens,I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--In celebration of this day with shows,Pageants and sights of honour.First GentlemanNever greater,Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.Second GentlemanMay I be bold to ask at what that contains,That paper in your hand?First GentlemanYes; 'tis the listOf those that claim their offices this dayBy custom of the coronation.The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claimsTo be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.Second GentlemanI thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,I should have been beholding to your paper.But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,The princess dowager? how goes her business?First GentlemanThat I can tell you too. The ArchbishopOf Canterbury, accompanied with otherLearned and reverend fathers of his order,Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles offFrom Ampthill where the princess lay; to whichShe was often cited by them, but appear'd not:And, to be short, for not appearance andThe king's late scruple, by the main assentOf all these learned men she was divorced,And the late marriage made of none effectSince which she was removed to Kimbolton,Where she remains now sick.Second GentlemanAlas, good lady!TrumpetsThe trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.HautboysTHE ORDER OF THE CORONATION1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.2. Then, two Judges.3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and macebefore him.4. Choristers, singing.Music5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. ThenGarter, in his coat of arms, and on hishead a gilt copper crown.6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,on his head a demi-coronal of gold. Withhim, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver withthe dove, crowned with an earl's coronet.Collars of SS.7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coroneton his head, bearing a long white wand, ashigh-steward. With him, NORFOLK, with therod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.Collars of SS.8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;under it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hairrichly adorned with pearl, crowned. On eachside her, the Bishops of London andWinchester.9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal ofgold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEENANNE's train.10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plaincirclets of gold without flowers.They pass over the stage in order and stateSecond GentlemanA royal train, believe me. These I know:Who's that that bears the sceptre?First GentlemanMarquess Dorset:And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.Second GentlemanA bold brave gentleman. That should beThe Duke of Suffolk?First Gentleman'Tis the same: high-steward.Second GentlemanAnd that my Lord of Norfolk?First GentlemanYes;Second GentlemanHeaven bless thee!Looking on QUEEN ANNEThou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;Our king has all the Indies in his arms,And more and richer, when he strains that lady:I cannot blame his conscience.First GentlemanThey that bearThe cloth of honour over her, are four baronsOf the Cinque-ports.Second GentlemanThose men are happy; and so are all are near her.I take it, she that carries up the trainIs that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.First GentlemanIt is; and all the rest are countesses.Second GentlemanTheir coronets say so. These are stars indeed;And sometimes falling ones.First GentlemanNo more of that.Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpetsEnter a third GentlemanFirst GentlemanGod save you, sir! where have you been broiling?Third GentlemanAmong the crowd i' the Abbey; where a fingerCould not be wedged in more: I am stifledWith the mere rankness of their joy.Second GentlemanYou sawThe ceremony?Third GentlemanThat I did.First GentlemanHow was it?Third GentlemanWell worth the seeing.Second GentlemanGood sir, speak it to us.Third GentlemanAs well as I am able. The rich streamOf lords and ladies, having brought the queenTo a prepared place in the choir, fell offA distance from her; while her grace sat downTo rest awhile, some half an hour or so,In a rich chair of state, opposing freelyThe beauty of her person to the people.Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest womanThat ever lay by man: which when the peopleHad the full view of, such a noise aroseAs the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their facesBeen loose, this day they had been lost. Such joyI never saw before. Great-bellied women,That had not half a week to go, like ramsIn the old time of war, would shake the press,And make 'em reel before 'em. No man livingCould say 'This is my wife' there; all were wovenSo strangely in one piece.Second GentlemanBut, what follow'd?Third GentlemanAt length her grace rose, and with modest pacesCame to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-likeCast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:When by the Archbishop of CanterburyShe had all the royal makings of a queen;As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblemsLaid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,With all the choicest music of the kingdom,Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,And with the same full state paced back againTo York-place, where the feast is held.First GentlemanSir,You must no more call it York-place, that's past;For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.Third GentlemanI know it;But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old nameIs fresh about me.Second GentlemanWhat two reverend bishopsWere those that went on each side of the queen?Third GentlemanStokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,The other, London.Second GentlemanHe of WinchesterIs held no great good lover of the archbishop's,The virtuous Cranmer.Third GentlemanAll the land knows that:However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.Second GentlemanWho may that be, I pray you?Third GentlemanThomas Cromwell;A man in much esteem with the king, and trulyA worthy friend. The king has made him masterO' the jewel house,And one, already, of the privy council.Second GentlemanHe will deserve more.Third GentlemanYes, without all doubt.Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, whichIs to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:Something I can command. As I walk thither,I'll tell ye more.BothYou may command us, sir.ExeuntSCENE II. Kimbolton.Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her womanGRIFFITHHow does your grace?KATHARINEO Griffith, sick to death!My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?GRIFFITHYes, madam; but I think your grace,Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.KATHARINEPrithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:If well, he stepp'd before me, happilyFor my example.GRIFFITHWell, the voice goes, madam:For after the stout Earl NorthumberlandArrested him at York, and brought him forward,As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,He fell sick suddenly, and grew so illHe could not sit his mule.KATHARINEAlas, poor man!GRIFFITHAt last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,With all his covent, honourably received him;To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,An old man, broken with the storms of state,Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;Give him a little earth for charity!'So went to bed; where eagerly his sicknessPursued him still: and, three nights after this,About the hour of eight, which he himselfForetold should be his last, full of repentance,Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,He gave his honours to the world again,His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.KATHARINESo may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,And yet with charity. He was a manOf an unbounded stomach, ever rankingHimself with princes; one that, by suggestion,Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;His own opinion was his law: i' the presenceHe would say untruths; and be ever doubleBoth in his words and meaning: he was never,But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:His promises were, as he then was, mighty;But his performance, as he is now, nothing:Of his own body he was ill, and gaveThe clergy in example.GRIFFITHNoble madam,Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtuesWe write in water. May it please your highnessTo hear me speak his good now?KATHARINEYes, good Griffith;I were malicious else.GRIFFITHThis cardinal,Though from an humble stock, undoubtedlyWas fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.And though he were unsatisfied in getting,Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,He was most princely: ever witness for himThose twins Of learning that he raised in you,Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,So excellent in art, and still so rising,That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;For then, and not till then, he felt himself,And found the blessedness of being little:And, to add greater honours to his ageThan man could give him, he died fearing God.KATHARINEAfter my death I wish no other herald,No other speaker of my living actions,To keep mine honour from corruption,But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,With thy religious truth and modesty,Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,Cause the musicians play me that sad noteI named my knell, whilst I sit meditatingOn that celestial harmony I go to.Sad and solemn musicGRIFFITHShe is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after  another, six personages, clad in white robes,  wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden  vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in  their hands. They first congee unto her, then  dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold  a spare garland over her head; at which the other  four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two,  who observe the same order in their changes, and  holding the garland over her head: which done,  they deliver the same garland to the last two, who  likewise observe the same order: at which, as it  were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:  and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continuesKATHARINESpirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?GRIFFITHMadam, we are here.KATHARINEIt is not you I call for:Saw ye none enter since I slept?GRIFFITHNone, madam.KATHARINENo? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troopInvite me to a banquet; whose bright facesCast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?They promised me eternal happiness;And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feelI am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.GRIFFITHI am most joyful, madam, such good dreamsPossess your fancy.KATHARINEBid the music leave,They are harsh and heavy to me.Music ceasesPATIENCEDo you noteHow much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!GRIFFITHShe is going, wench: pray, pray.PATIENCEHeaven comfort her!Enter a MessengerMessengerAn't like your grace,--KATHARINEYou are a saucy fellow:Deserve we no more reverence?GRIFFITHYou are to blame,Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.MessengerI humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;My haste made me unmannerly. There is stayingA gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.KATHARINEAdmit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellowLet me ne'er see again.Exeunt GRIFFITH and MessengerRe-enter GRIFFITH, with CAPUCIUSIf my sight fail not,You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.CAPUCIUSMadam, the same; your servant.KATHARINEO, my lord,The times and titles now are alter'd strangelyWith me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,What is your pleasure with me?CAPUCIUSNoble lady,First mine own service to your grace; the next,The king's request that I would visit you;Who grieves much for your weakness, and by meSends you his princely commendations,And heartily entreats you take good comfort.KATHARINEO my good lord, that comfort comes too late;'Tis like a pardon after execution:That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.How does his highness?CAPUCIUSMadam, in good health.KATHARINESo may he ever do! and ever flourish,When I shal l dwell with worms, and my poor nameBanish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,I caused you write, yet sent away?PATIENCENo, madam.Giving it to KATHARINEKATHARINESir, I most humbly pray you to deliverThis to my lord the king.CAPUCIUSMost willing, madam.KATHARINEIn which I have commended to his goodnessThe model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--She is young, and of a noble modest nature,I hope she will deserve well,--and a littleTo love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petitionIs, that his noble grace would have some pityUpon my wretched women, that so longHave follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:Of which there is not one, I dare avow,And now I should not lie, but will deserveFor virtue and true beauty of the soul,For honesty and decent carriage,A right good husband, let him be a nobleAnd, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,But poverty could never draw 'em from me;That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,And something over to remember me by:If heaven had pleased to have given me longer lifeAnd able means, we had not parted thus.These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,By that you love the dearest in this world,As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the kingTo do me this last right.CAPUCIUSBy heaven, I will,Or let me lose the fashion of a man!KATHARINEI thank you, honest lord. Remember meIn all humility unto his highness:Say his long trouble now is passingOut of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,Let me be used with honour: strew me overWith maiden flowers, that all the world may knowI was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet likeA queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.I can no more.Exeunt, leading KATHARINEACT VSCENE I.

The archbishopIs the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speakOne syllable against him?GARDINERYes, yes, Sir Thomas,There are that dare; and I myself have venturedTo speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,Sir, I may tell it you, I think I haveIncensed the lords o' the council, that he is,For so I know he is, they know he is,A most arch heretic, a pestilenceThat does infect the land: with which they movedHave broken with the king; who hath so farGiven ear to our complaint, of his great graceAnd princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefsOur reasons laid before him, hath commandedTo-morrow morning to the council-boardHe be convented.

If we suffer,Out of our easiness and childish pityTo one man's honour, this contagious sickness,Farewell all physic: and what follows then?Commotions, uproars, with a general taintOf the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,The upper Germany, can dearly witness,Yet freshly pitied in our memories.CRANMERMy good lords, hitherto, in all the progressBoth of my life and office, I have labour'd,And with no little study, that my teachingAnd the strong course of my authorityMight go one way, and safely; and the endWas ever, to do well: nor is there living,I speak it with a single heart, my lords,A man that more detests, more stirs against,Both in his private conscience and his place,Defacers of a public peace, than I do.Pray heaven, the king may never find a heartWith less allegiance in it! Men that makeEnvy and crooked malice nourishmentDare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,That, in this case of justice, my accusers,Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,And freely urge against me.SUFFOLKNay, my lord,That cannot be: you are a counsellor,And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.GARDINERMy lord, because we have business of more moment,We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,And our consent, for better trial of you,From hence you be committed to the Tower;Where, being but a private man again,You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,More than, I fear, you are provided for.CRANMERAh, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;You are always my good friend; if your will pass,I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,You are so merciful: I see your end;'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,Become a churchman better than ambition:Win straying souls with modesty again,Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,I make as little doubt, as you do conscienceIn doing daily wrongs. I could say more,But reverence to your calling makes me modest.GARDINERMy lord, my lord, you are a sectary,That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,To men that understand you, words and weakness.CROMWELLMy Lord of Winchester, you are a little,By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,However faulty, yet should find respectFor what they have been: 'tis a crueltyTo load a falling man.GARDINERGood master secretary,I cry your honour mercy; you may, worstOf all this table, say so.CROMWELLWhy, my lord?GARDINERDo not I know you for a favourerOf this new sect? ye are not sound.CROMWELLNot sound?GARDINERNot sound, I say.CROMWELLWould you were half so honest!Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.GARDINERI shall remember this bold language.CROMWELLDo.Remember your bold life too.ChancellorThis is too much;Forbear, for shame, my lords.GARDINERI have done.CROMWELLAnd I.ChancellorThen thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,I take it, by all voices, that forthwithYou be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;There to remain till the king's further pleasureBe known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?AllWe are.CRANMERIs there no other way of mercy,But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?GARDINERWhat otherWould you expect? you are strangely troublesome.Let some o' the guard be ready there.Enter GuardCRANMERFor me?Must I go like a traitor thither?GARDINERReceive him,And see him safe i' the Tower.CRANMERStay, good my lords,I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;By virtue of that ring, I take my causeOut of the gripes of cruel men, and give itTo a most noble judge, the king my master.ChamberlainThis is the king's ring.SURREY'Tis no counterfeit.SUFFOLK'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,'Twould fall upon ourselves.NORFOLKDo you think, my lords,The king will suffer but the little fingerOf this man to be vex'd?Chancellor'Tis now too certain:How much more is his life in value with him?Would I were fairly out on't!CROMWELLMy mind gave me,In seeking tales and informationsAgainst this man, whose honesty the devilAnd his disciples only envy at,Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!Enter KING, frowning on them; takes his seatGARDINERDread sovereign, how much are we bound to heavenIn daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;Not only good and wise, but most religious:One that, in all obedience, makes the churchThe chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthenThat holy duty, out of dear respect,His royal self in judgment comes to hearThe cause betwixt her and this great offender.KING HENRY VIIIYou were ever good at sudden commendations,Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come notTo hear such flattery now, and in my presence;They are too thin and bare to hide offences.To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sureThou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.To CRANMERGood man, sit down. Now let me see the proudestHe, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:By all that's holy, he had better starveThan but once think this place becomes thee not.SURREYMay it please your grace,--KING HENRY VIIINo, sir, it does not please me.I had thought I had had men of some understandingAnd wisdom of my council; but I find none.Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--This honest man, wait like a lousy footboyAt chamber--door? and one as great as you are?Why, what a shame was this! Did my commissionBid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave yePower as he was a counsellor to try him,Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,More out of malice than integrity,Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;Which ye shall never have while I live.ChancellorThus far,My most dread sovereign, may it like your graceTo let my tongue excuse all. What was purposedConcerning his imprisonment, was rather,If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,And fair purgation to the world, than malice,I'm sure, in me.KING HENRY VIIIWell, well, my lords, respect him;Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.I will say thus much for him, if a princeMay be beholding to a subject, IAm, for his love and service, so to him.Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord ofCanterbury,I have a suit which you must not deny me;That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,You must be godfather, and answer for her.CRANMERThe greatest monarch now alive may gloryIn such an honour: how may I deserve itThat am a poor and humble subject to you?KING HENRY VIIICome, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons: youshall have two noble partners with you; the oldDuchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: willthese please you?Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,Embrace and love this man.GARDINERWith a true heartAnd brother-love I do it.CRANMERAnd let heavenWitness, how dear I hold this confirmation.KING HENRY VIIIGood man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:The common voice, I see, is verifiedOf thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of CanterburyA shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'Come, lords, we trifle time away; I longTo have this young one made a Christian.As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.ExeuntSCENE IV. The palace yard.Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his ManPorterYou'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do youtake the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,leave your gaping.WithinGood master porter, I belong to the larder.PorterBelong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! isthis a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-treestaves, and strong ones: these are but switches to'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeingchristenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,you rude rascals?ManPray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleepOn May-day morning; which will never be:We may as well push against Powle's, as stir em.PorterHow got they in, and be hang'd?ManAlas, I know not; how gets the tide in?As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--You see the poor remainder--could distribute,I made no spare, sir.PorterYou did nothing, sir.ManI am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared anyThat had a head to hit, either young or old,He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,Let me ne'er hope to see a chine againAnd that I would not for a cow, God save her!WithinDo you hear, master porter?PorterI shall be with you presently, good master puppy.Keep the door close, sirrah.ManWhat would you have me do?PorterWhat should you do, but knock 'em down by thedozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or havewe some strange Indian with the great tool come tocourt, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what afry of fornication is at door! On my Christianconscience, this one christening will beget athousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.ManThe spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is afellow somewhat near the door, he should be abrazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twentyof the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that standabout him are under the line, they need no otherpenance: that fire-drake did I hit three times onthe head, and three times was his nose dischargedagainst me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, toblow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of smallwit near him, that railed upon me till her pinkedporringer fell off her head, for kindling such acombustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when Imight see from far some forty truncheoners draw toher succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, whereshe was quartered. They fell on; I made good myplace: at length they came to the broom-staff tome; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file ofboys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a showerof pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst'em, I think, surely.PorterThese are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, butthe tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs ofLimehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there theyare like to dance these three days; besides therunning banquet of two beadles that is to come.Enter ChamberlainChamberlainMercy o' me, what a multitude are here!They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:There's a trim rabble let in: are all theseYour faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall haveGreat store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,When they pass back from the christening.PorterAn't pleaseyour honour,We are but men; and what so many may do,Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:An army cannot rule 'em.ChamberlainAs I live,If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye allBy the heels, and suddenly; and on your headsClap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;And here ye lie baiting of bombards, whenYe should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;They're come already from the christening:Go, break among the press, and find a way outTo let the troop pass fairly; or I'll findA Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.PorterMake way there for the princess.ManYou great fellow,Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.PorterYou i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;I'll peck you o'er the pales else.ExeuntSCENE V. The palace.Enter trumpets, sounding; then two Aldermen, Lord  Mayor, Garter, CRANMER, NORFOLK with his marshal's  staff, SUFFOLK, two Noblemen bearing great  standing-bowls for the christening-gifts; then  four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the  Duchess of Norfolk, godmother, bearing the child  richly habited in a mantle,  & c., train borne by a  Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset, the  other godmother, and Ladies. The troop pass once about the stage, and Garter speaksGarterHeaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperouslife, long, and ever happy, to the high and mightyprincess of England, Elizabeth!Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and GuardCRANMER[Kneeling] And to your royal grace, and the good queen,My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,May hourly fall upon ye!KING HENRY VIIIThank you, good lord archbishop:What is her name?CRANMERElizabeth.KING HENRY VIIIStand up, lord.KING HENRY VIII kisses the childWith this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!Into whose hand I give thy life.CRANMERAmen.KING HENRY VIIIMy noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,When she has so much English.CRANMERLet me speak, sir,For heaven now bids me; and the words I utterLet none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--Though in her cradle, yet now promisesUpon this land a thousand thousand blessings,Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--But few now living can behold that goodness--A pattern to all princes living with her,And all that shall succeed: Saba was neverMore covetous of wisdom and fair virtueThan this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,With all the virtues that attend the good,Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:In her days every man shall eat in safety,Under his own vine, what he plants; and singThe merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:God shall be truly known; and those about herFrom her shall read the perfect ways of honour,And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as whenThe bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,Her ashes new create another heir,As great in admiration as herself;So shall she leave her blessedness to one,When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,Who from the sacred ashes of her honourShall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,That were the servants to this chosen infant,Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,His honour and the greatness of his nameShall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branchesTo all the plains about him: our children's childrenShall see this, and bless heaven.KING HENRY VIIIThou speakest wonders.CRANMERShe shall be, to the happiness of England,An aged princess; many days shall see her,And yet no day without a deed to crown it.Would I had known no more! but she must die,She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,A most unspotted lily shall she passTo the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.KING HENRY VIIIO lord archbishop,Thou hast made me now a man! never, beforeThis happy child, did I get any thing:This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,That when I am in heaven I shall desireTo see what this child does, and praise my Maker.I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,And your good brethren, I am much beholding;I have received much honour by your presence,And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,She will be sick else. This day, no man thinkHas business at his house; for all shall stay:This little one shall make it holiday.ExeuntEPILOGUE'Tis ten to one this play can never pleaseAll that are here: some come to take their ease,And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the cityAbused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,All the expected good we're like to hearFor this play at this time, is only inThe merciful construction of good women;For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,And say 'twill do, I know, within a whileAll the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.
