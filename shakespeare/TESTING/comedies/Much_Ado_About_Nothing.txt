ACT ISCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a MessengerLEONATOI learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragoncomes this night to Messina.MessengerHe is very near by this: he was not three leagues offwhen I left him.LEONATOHow many gentlemen have you lost in this action?MessengerBut few of any sort, and none of name.LEONATOA victory is twice itself when the achiever bringshome full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hathbestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.MessengerMuch deserved on his part and equally remembered byDon Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond thepromise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,the feats of a lion: he hath indeed betterbettered expectation than you must expect of me totell you how.LEONATOHe hath an uncle here in Messina will be very muchglad of it.MessengerI have already delivered him letters, and thereappears much joy in him; even so much that joy couldnot show itself modest enough without a badge ofbitterness.LEONATODid he break out into tears?MessengerIn great measure.LEONATOA kind overflow of kindness: there are no facestruer than those that are so washed. How muchbetter is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!BEATRICEI pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from thewars or no?MessengerI know none of that name, lady: there was none suchin the army of any sort.LEONATOWhat is he that you ask for, niece?HEROMy cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.MessengerO, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.BEATRICEHe set up his bills here in Messina and challengedCupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, readingthe challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challengedhim at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath hekilled and eaten in these wars? But how many hathhe killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.LEONATOFaith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.MessengerHe hath done good service, lady, in these wars.BEATRICEYou had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath anexcellent stomach.MessengerAnd a good soldier too, lady.BEATRICEAnd a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?MessengerA lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with allhonourable virtues.BEATRICEIt is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.LEONATOYou must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is akind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:they never meet but there's a skirmish of witbetween them.BEATRICEAlas! he gets nothing by that. In our lastconflict four of his five wits went halting off, andnow is the whole man governed with one: so that ifhe have wit enough to keep himself warm, let himbear it for a difference between himself and hishorse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,to be known a reasonable creature. Who is hiscompanion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.MessengerIs't possible?BEATRICEVery easily possible: he wears his faith but asthe fashion of his hat; it ever changes with thenext block.MessengerI see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.BEATRICENo; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I prayyou, who is his companion? Is there no youngsquarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?MessengerHe is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.BEATRICEO Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: heis sooner caught than the pestilence, and the takerruns presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! ifhe have caught the Benedick, it will cost him athousand pound ere a' be cured.MessengerI will hold friends with you, lady.BEATRICEDo, good friend.LEONATOYou will never run mad, niece.BEATRICENo, not till a hot January.MessengerDon Pedro is approached.Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASARDON PEDROGood Signior Leonato, you are come to meet yourtrouble: the fashion of the world is to avoidcost, and you encounter it.LEONATONever came trouble to my house in the likeness ofyour grace: for trouble being gone, comfort shouldremain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abidesand happiness takes his leave.DON PEDROYou embrace your charge too willingly. I think thisis your daughter.LEONATOHer mother hath many times told me so.BENEDICKWere you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?LEONATOSignior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.DON PEDROYou have it full, Benedick: we may guess by thiswhat you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathersherself. Be happy, lady; for you are like anhonourable father.BENEDICKIf Signior Leonato be her father, she would nothave his head on her shoulders for all Messina, aslike him as she is.BEATRICEI wonder that you will still be talking, SigniorBenedick: nobody marks you.BENEDICKWhat, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?BEATRICEIs it possible disdain should die while she hathsuch meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you comein her presence.BENEDICKThen is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain Iam loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and Iwould I could find in my heart that I had not a hardheart; for, truly, I love none.BEATRICEA dear happiness to women: they would else havebeen troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank Godand my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: Ihad rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a manswear he loves me.BENEDICKGod keep your ladyship still in that mind! so somegentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinatescratched face.BEATRICEScratching could not make it worse, an 'twere sucha face as yours were.BENEDICKWell, you are a rare parrot-teacher.BEATRICEA bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.BENEDICKI would my horse had the speed of your tongue, andso good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God'sname; I have done.BEATRICEYou always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.DON PEDROThat is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudioand Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hathinvited you all. I tell him we shall stay here atthe least a month; and he heartily prays someoccasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is nohypocrite, but prays from his heart.LEONATOIf you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.To DON JOHNLet me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled tothe prince your brother, I owe you all duty.DON JOHNI thank you: I am not of many words, but I thankyou.LEONATOPlease it your grace lead on?DON PEDROYour hand, Leonato; we will go together.Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIOCLAUDIOBenedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?BENEDICKI noted her not; but I looked on her.CLAUDIOIs she not a modest young lady?BENEDICKDo you question me, as an honest man should do, formy simple true judgment; or would you have me speakafter my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?CLAUDIONo; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.BENEDICKWhy, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a highpraise, too brown for a fair praise and too littlefor a great praise: only this commendation I canafford her, that were she other than she is, shewere unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, Ido not like her.CLAUDIOThou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell metruly how thou likest her.BENEDICKWould you buy her, that you inquire after her?CLAUDIOCan the world buy such a jewel?BENEDICKYea, and a case to put it into. But speak you thiswith a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan arare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man takeyou, to go in the song?CLAUDIOIn mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever Ilooked on.BENEDICKI can see yet without spectacles and I see no suchmatter: there's her cousin, an she were notpossessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beautyas the first of May doth the last of December. But Ihope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?CLAUDIOI would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn thecontrary, if Hero would be my wife.BENEDICKIs't come to this? In faith, hath not the worldone man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neckinto a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh awaySundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.Re-enter DON PEDRODON PEDROWhat secret hath held you here, that you followednot to Leonato's?BENEDICKI would your grace would constrain me to tell.DON PEDROI charge thee on thy allegiance.BENEDICKYou hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumbman; I would have you think so; but, on myallegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He isin love. With who? now that is your grace's part.Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato'sshort daughter.CLAUDIOIf this were so, so were it uttered.BENEDICKLike the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should beso.'CLAUDIOIf my passion change not shortly, God forbid itshould be otherwise.DON PEDROAmen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.CLAUDIOYou speak this to fetch me in, my lord.DON PEDROBy my troth, I speak my thought.CLAUDIOAnd, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.BENEDICKAnd, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.CLAUDIOThat I love her, I feel.DON PEDROThat she is worthy, I know.BENEDICKThat I neither feel how she should be loved norknow how she should be worthy, is the opinion thatfire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.DON PEDROThou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despiteof beauty.CLAUDIOAnd never could maintain his part but in the forceof his will.BENEDICKThat a woman conceived me, I thank her; that shebrought me up, I likewise give her most humblethanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in myforehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,all women shall pardon me. Because I will not dothem the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself theright to trust none; and the fine is, for the whichI may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.DON PEDROI shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.BENEDICKWith anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,not with love: prove that ever I lose more bloodwith love than I will get again with drinking, pickout mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang meup at the door of a brothel-house for the sign ofblind Cupid.DON PEDROWell, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thouwilt prove a notable argument.BENEDICKIf I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shootat me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped onthe shoulder, and called Adam.DON PEDROWell, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bulldoth bear the yoke.'BENEDICKThe savage bull may; but if ever the sensibleBenedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and setthem in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,and in such great letters as they write 'Here isgood horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'CLAUDIOIf this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.DON PEDRONay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver inVenice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.BENEDICKI look for an earthquake too, then.DON PEDROWell, you temporize with the hours. In themeantime, good Signior Benedick, repair toLeonato's: commend me to him and tell him I willnot fail him at supper; for indeed he hath madegreat preparation.BENEDICKI have almost matter enough in me for such anembassage; and so I commit you--CLAUDIOTo the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--DON PEDROThe sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.BENEDICKNay, mock not, mock not. The body of yourdiscourse is sometime guarded with fragments, andthe guards are but slightly basted on neither: ereyou flout old ends any further, examine yourconscience: and so I leave you.ExitCLAUDIOMy liege, your highness now may do me good.DON PEDROMy love is thine to teach: teach it but how,And thou shalt see how apt it is to learnAny hard lesson that may do thee good.CLAUDIOHath Leonato any son, my lord?DON PEDRONo child but Hero; she's his only heir.Dost thou affect her, Claudio?CLAUDIOO, my lord,When you went onward on this ended action,I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,That liked, but had a rougher task in handThan to drive liking to the name of love:But now I am return'd and that war-thoughtsHave left their places vacant, in their roomsCome thronging soft and delicate desires,All prompting me how fair young Hero is,Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.DON PEDROThou wilt be like a lover presentlyAnd tire the hearer with a book of words.If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,And I will break with her and with her father,And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this endThat thou began'st to twist so fine a story?CLAUDIOHow sweetly you do minister to love,That know love's grief by his complexion!But lest my liking might too sudden seem,I would have salved it with a longer treatise.DON PEDROWhat need the bridge much broader than the flood?The fairest grant is the necessity.Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,And I will fit thee with the remedy.I know we shall have revelling to-night:I will assume thy part in some disguiseAnd tell fair Hero I am Claudio,And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heartAnd take her hearing prisoner with the forceAnd strong encounter of my amorous tale:Then after to her father will I break;And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.In practise let us put it presently.ExeuntSCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meetingLEONATOHow now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?hath he provided this music?ANTONIOHe is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tellyou strange news that you yet dreamt not of.LEONATOAre they good?ANTONIOAs the event stamps them: but they have a goodcover; they show well outward. The prince and CountClaudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mineorchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved myniece your daughter and meant to acknowledge itthis night in a dance: and if he found heraccordant, he meant to take the present time by thetop and instantly break with you of it.LEONATOHath the fellow any wit that told you this?ANTONIOA good sharp fellow: I will send for him; andquestion him yourself.LEONATONo, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appearitself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,that she may be the better prepared for an answer,if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.Enter AttendantsCousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry youmercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use yourskill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.ExeuntSCENE III. The same.Enter DON JOHN and CONRADECONRADEWhat the good-year, my lord! why are you thus outof measure sad?DON JOHNThere is no measure in the occasion that breeds;therefore the sadness is without limit.CONRADEYou should hear reason.DON JOHNAnd when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?CONRADEIf not a present remedy, at least a patientsufferance.DON JOHNI wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moralmedicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hidewhat I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smileat no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and waitfor no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy andtend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry andclaw no man in his humour.CONRADEYea, but you must not make the full show of thistill you may do it without controlment. You have oflate stood out against your brother, and he hathta'en you newly into his grace; where it isimpossible you should take true root but by thefair weather that you make yourself: it is needfulthat you frame the season for your own harvest.DON JOHNI had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose inhis grace, and it better fits my blood to bedisdained of all than to fashion a carriage to roblove from any: in this, though I cannot be said tobe a flattering honest man, it must not be deniedbut I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted witha muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore Ihave decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had mymouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would domy liking: in the meantime let me be that I am andseek not to alter me.CONRADECan you make no use of your discontent?DON JOHNI make all use of it, for I use it only.Who comes here?Enter BORACHIOWhat news, Borachio?BORACHIOI came yonder from a great supper: the prince yourbrother is royally entertained by Leonato: and Ican give you intelligence of an intended marriage.DON JOHNWill it serve for any model to build mischief on?What is he for a fool that betroths himself tounquietness?BORACHIOMarry, it is your brother's right hand.DON JOHNWho? the most exquisite Claudio?BORACHIOEven he.DON JOHNA proper squire! And who, and who? which way lookshe?BORACHIOMarry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.DON JOHNA very forward March-chick! How came you to this?BORACHIOBeing entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking amusty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, handin hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind thearras; and there heard it agreed upon that theprince should woo Hero for himself, and havingobtained her, give her to Count Claudio.DON JOHNCome, come, let us thither: this may prove food tomy displeasure. That young start-up hath all theglory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, Ibless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?CONRADETo the death, my lord.DON JOHNLet us to the great supper: their cheer is thegreater that I am subdued. Would the cook were ofmy mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?BORACHIOWe'll wait upon your lordship.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and othersLEONATOWas not Count John here at supper?ANTONIOI saw him not.BEATRICEHow tartly that gentleman looks! I never can seehim but I am heart-burned an hour after.HEROHe is of a very melancholy disposition.BEATRICEHe were an excellent man that were made just in themidway between him and Benedick: the one is toolike an image and says nothing, and the other toolike my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.LEONATOThen half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John'smouth, and half Count John's melancholy in SigniorBenedick's face,--BEATRICEWith a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and moneyenough in his purse, such a man would win any womanin the world, if a' could get her good-will.LEONATOBy my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee ahusband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.ANTONIOIn faith, she's too curst.BEATRICEToo curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God'ssending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curstcow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.LEONATOSo, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.BEATRICEJust, if he send me no husband; for the whichblessing I am at him upon my knees every morning andevening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with abeard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.LEONATOYou may light on a husband that hath no beard.BEATRICEWhat should I do with him? dress him in my appareland make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath abeard is more than a youth, and he that hath nobeard is less than a man: and he that is more thana youth is not for me, and he that is less than aman, I am not for him: therefore, I will even takesixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead hisapes into hell.LEONATOWell, then, go you into hell?BEATRICENo, but to the gate; and there will the devil meetme, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, andsay 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you toheaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliverI up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for theheavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, andthere live we as merry as the day is long.ANTONIO[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruledby your father.BEATRICEYes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsyand say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for allthat, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or elsemake another curtsy and say 'Father, as it pleaseme.'LEONATOWell, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.BEATRICENot till God make men of some other metal thanearth. Would it not grieve a woman to beovermastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to makean account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.LEONATODaughter, remember what I told you: if the princedo solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.BEATRICEThe fault will be in the music, cousin, if you benot wooed in good time: if the prince be tooimportant, tell him there is measure in every thingand so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hotand hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full asfantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as ameasure, full of state and ancientry; and then comesrepentance and, with his bad legs, falls into thecinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.LEONATOCousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.BEATRICEI have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.LEONATOThe revellers are entering, brother: make good room.All put on their masksEnter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, maskedDON PEDROLady, will you walk about with your friend?HEROSo you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.DON PEDROWith me in your company?HEROI may say so, when I please.DON PEDROAnd when please you to say so?HEROWhen I like your favour; for God defend the luteshould be like the case!DON PEDROMy visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.HEROWhy, then, your visor should be thatched.DON PEDROSpeak low, if you speak love.Drawing her asideBALTHASARWell, I would you did like me.MARGARETSo would not I, for your own sake; for I have manyill-qualities.BALTHASARWhich is one?MARGARETI say my prayers aloud.BALTHASARI love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.MARGARETGod match me with a good dancer!BALTHASARAmen.MARGARETAnd God keep him out of my sight when the dance isdone! Answer, clerk.BALTHASARNo more words: the clerk is answered.URSULAI know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.ANTONIOAt a word, I am not.URSULAI know you by the waggling of your head.ANTONIOTo tell you true, I counterfeit him.URSULAYou could never do him so ill-well, unless you werethe very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: youare he, you are he.ANTONIOAt a word, I am not.URSULACome, come, do you think I do not know you by yourexcellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's anend.BEATRICEWill you not tell me who told you so?BENEDICKNo, you shall pardon me.BEATRICENor will you not tell me who you are?BENEDICKNot now.BEATRICEThat I was disdainful, and that I had my good witout of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this wasSignior Benedick that said so.BENEDICKWhat's he?BEATRICEI am sure you know him well enough.BENEDICKNot I, believe me.BEATRICEDid he never make you laugh?BENEDICKI pray you, what is he?BEATRICEWhy, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:none but libertines delight in him; and thecommendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;for he both pleases men and angers them, and thenthey laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is inthe fleet: I would he had boarded me.BENEDICKWhen I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.BEATRICEDo, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,strikes him into melancholy; and then there's apartridge wing saved, for the fool will eat nosupper that night.MusicWe must follow the leaders.BENEDICKIn every good thing.BEATRICENay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them atthe next turning.Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIODON JOHNSure my brother is amorous on Hero and hathwithdrawn her father to break with him about it.The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.BORACHIOAnd that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.DON JOHNAre not you Signior Benedick?CLAUDIOYou know me well; I am he.DON JOHNSignior, you are very near my brother in his love:he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade himfrom her: she is no equal for his birth: you maydo the part of an honest man in it.CLAUDIOHow know you he loves her?DON JOHNI heard him swear his affection.BORACHIOSo did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.DON JOHNCome, let us to the banquet.Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIOCLAUDIOThus answer I in the name of Benedick,But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.Friendship is constant in all other thingsSave in the office and affairs of love:Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;Let every eye negotiate for itselfAnd trust no agent; for beauty is a witchAgainst whose charms faith melteth into blood.This is an accident of hourly proof,Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!Re-enter BENEDICKBENEDICKCount Claudio?CLAUDIOYea, the same.BENEDICKCome, will you go with me?CLAUDIOWhither?BENEDICKEven to the next willow, about your own business,county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or underyour arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wearit one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.CLAUDIOI wish him joy of her.BENEDICKWhy, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so theysell bullocks. But did you think the prince wouldhave served you thus?CLAUDIOI pray you, leave me.BENEDICKHo! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas theboy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.CLAUDIOIf it will not be, I'll leave you.ExitBENEDICKAlas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and notknow me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I gounder that title because I am merry. Yea, but so Iam apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: itis the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatricethat puts the world into her person and so gives meout. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.Re-enter DON PEDRODON PEDRONow, signior, where's the count? did you see him?BENEDICKTroth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in awarren: I told him, and I think I told him true,that your grace had got the good will of this younglady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, orto bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.DON PEDROTo be whipped! What's his fault?BENEDICKThe flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, beingoverjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it hiscompanion, and he steals it.DON PEDROWilt thou make a trust a transgression? Thetransgression is in the stealer.BENEDICKYet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,and the garland too; for the garland he might haveworn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed onyou, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.DON PEDROI will but teach them to sing, and restore them tothe owner.BENEDICKIf their singing answer your saying, by my faith,you say honestly.DON PEDROThe Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: thegentleman that danced with her told her she is muchwronged by you.BENEDICKO, she misused me past the endurance of a block!an oak but with one green leaf on it would haveanswered her; my very visor began to assume life andscold with her. She told me, not thinking I had beenmyself, that I was the prince's jester, that I wasduller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jestwith such impossible conveyance upon me that I stoodlike a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting atme. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,there were no living near her; she would infect tothe north star. I would not marry her, though shewere endowed with all that Adam bad left him beforehe transgressed: she would have made Hercules haveturned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to makethe fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall findher the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to Godsome scholar would conjure her; for certainly, whileshe is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in asanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because theywould go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horrorand perturbation follows her.DON PEDROLook, here she comes.Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATOBENEDICKWill your grace command me any service to theworld's end? I will go on the slightest errand nowto the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from thefurthest inch of Asia, bring you the length ofPrester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the greatCham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,rather than hold three words' conference with thisharpy. You have no employment for me?DON PEDRONone, but to desire your good company.BENEDICKO God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannotendure my Lady Tongue.ExitDON PEDROCome, lady, come; you have lost the heart ofSignior Benedick.BEATRICEIndeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gavehim use for it, a double heart for his single one:marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.DON PEDROYou have put him down, lady, you have put him down.BEATRICESo I would not he should do me, my lord, lest Ishould prove the mother of fools. I have broughtCount Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.DON PEDROWhy, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?CLAUDIONot sad, my lord.DON PEDROHow then? sick?CLAUDIONeither, my lord.BEATRICEThe count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, norwell; but civil count, civil as an orange, andsomething of that jealous complexion.DON PEDROI' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit isfalse. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, andfair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,and his good will obtained: name the day ofmarriage, and God give thee joy!LEONATOCount, take of me my daughter, and with her myfortunes: his grace hath made the match, and angrace say Amen to it.BEATRICESpeak, count, 'tis your cue.CLAUDIOSilence is the perfectest herald of joy: I werebut little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, asyou are mine, I am yours: I give away myself foryou and dote upon the exchange.BEATRICESpeak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouthwith a kiss, and let not him speak neither.DON PEDROIn faith, lady, you have a merry heart.BEATRICEYea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps onthe windy side of care. My cousin tells him in hisear that he is in her heart.CLAUDIOAnd so she doth, cousin.BEATRICEGood Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to theworld but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in acorner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!DON PEDROLady Beatrice, I will get you one.BEATRICEI would rather have one of your father's getting.Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Yourfather got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.DON PEDROWill you have me, lady?BEATRICENo, my lord, unless I might have another forworking-days: your grace is too costly to wearevery day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: Iwas born to speak all mirth and no matter.DON PEDROYour silence most offends me, and to be merry bestbecomes you; for, out of question, you were born ina merry hour.BEATRICENo, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then therewas a star danced, and under that was I born.Cousins, God give you joy!LEONATONiece, will you look to those things I told you of?BEATRICEI cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.ExitDON PEDROBy my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.LEONATOThere's little of the melancholy element in her, mylord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, andnot ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and wakedherself with laughing.DON PEDROShe cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.LEONATOO, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.DON PEDROShe were an excellent wife for Benedict.LEONATOO Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,they would talk themselves mad.DON PEDROCounty Claudio, when mean you to go to church?CLAUDIOTo-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till lovehave all his rites.LEONATONot till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a justseven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have allthings answer my mind.DON PEDROCome, you shake the head at so long a breathing:but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not godully by us. I will in the interim undertake one ofHercules' labours; which is, to bring SigniorBenedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain ofaffection the one with the other. I would fain haveit a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, ifyou three will but minister such assistance as Ishall give you direction.LEONATOMy lord, I am for you, though it cost me tennights' watchings.CLAUDIOAnd I, my lord.DON PEDROAnd you too, gentle Hero?HEROI will do any modest office, my lord, to help mycousin to a good husband.DON PEDROAnd Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband thatI know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noblestrain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. Iwill teach you how to humour your cousin, that sheshall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with yourtwo helps, will so practise on Benedick that, indespite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, heshall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall beours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,and I will tell you my drift.ExeuntSCENE II. The same.Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIODON JOHNIt is so; the Count Claudio shall marry thedaughter of Leonato.BORACHIOYea, my lord; but I can cross it.DON JOHNAny bar, any cross, any impediment will bemedicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,and whatsoever comes athwart his affection rangesevenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?BORACHIONot honestly, my lord; but so covertly that nodishonesty shall appear in me.DON JOHNShow me briefly how.BORACHIOI think I told your lordship a year since, how muchI am in the favour of Margaret, the waitinggentlewoman to Hero.DON JOHNI remember.BORACHIOI can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.DON JOHNWhat life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?BORACHIOThe poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you tothe prince your brother; spare not to tell him thathe hath wronged his honour in marrying the renownedClaudio--whose estimation do you mightily holdup--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.DON JOHNWhat proof shall I make of that?BORACHIOProof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for anyother issue?DON JOHNOnly to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.BORACHIOGo, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro andthe Count Claudio alone: tell them that you knowthat Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to theprince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother'shonour, who hath made this match, and his friend'sreputation, who is thus like to be cozened with thesemblance of a maid,--that you have discoveredthus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:offer them instances; which shall bear no lesslikelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term meClaudio; and bring them to see this the very nightbefore the intended wedding,--for in the meantime Iwill so fashion the matter that Hero shall beabsent,--and there shall appear such seeming truthof Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be calledassurance and all the preparation overthrown.DON JOHNGrow this to what adverse issue it can, I will putit in practise. Be cunning in the working this, andthy fee is a thousand ducats.BORACHIOBe you constant in the accusation, and my cunningshall not shame me.DON JOHNI will presently go learn their day of marriage.ExeuntSCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.Enter BENEDICKBENEDICKBoy!Enter BoyBoySignior?BENEDICKIn my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hitherto me in the orchard.BoyI am here already, sir.BENEDICKI know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.Exit BoyI do much wonder that one man, seeing how muchanother man is a fool when he dedicates hisbehaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed atsuch shallow follies in others, become the argumentof his own scorn by failing in love: and such a manis Claudio. I have known when there was no musicwith him but the drum and the fife; and now had herather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have knownwhen he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see agood armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont tospeak plain and to the purpose, like an honest manand a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; hiswords are a very fantastical banquet, just so manystrange dishes. May I be so converted and see withthese eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will notbe sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; butI'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oysterof me, he shall never make me such a fool. One womanis fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I amwell; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till allgraces be in one woman, one woman shall not come inmy grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come notnear me; noble, or not I for an angel; of gooddiscourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shallbe of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince andMonsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.WithdrawsEnter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATODON PEDROCome, shall we hear this music?CLAUDIOYea, my good lord. How still the evening is,As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!DON PEDROSee you where Benedick hath hid himself?CLAUDIOO, very well, my lord: the music ended,We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.Enter BALTHASAR with MusicDON PEDROCome, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.BALTHASARO, good my lord, tax not so bad a voiceTo slander music any more than once.DON PEDROIt is the witness still of excellencyTo put a strange face on his own perfection.I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.BALTHASARBecause you talk of wooing, I will sing;Since many a wooer doth commence his suitTo her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,Yet will he swear he loves.DON PEDRONow, pray thee, come;Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,Do it in notes.BALTHASARNote this before my notes;There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.DON PEDROWhy, these are very crotchets that he speaks;Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.AirBENEDICKNow, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is itnot strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls outof men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, whenall's done.The SongBALTHASARSigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,Men were deceivers ever,One foot in sea and one on shore,To one thing constant never:Then sigh not so, but let them go,And be you blithe and bonny,Converting all your sounds of woeInto Hey nonny, nonny.Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,Of dumps so dull and heavy;The fraud of men was ever so,Since summer first was leafy:Then sigh not so,  & c.DON PEDROBy my troth, a good song.BALTHASARAnd an ill singer, my lord.DON PEDROHa, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.BENEDICKAn he had been a dog that should have howled thus,they would have hanged him: and I pray God his badvoice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard thenight-raven, come what plague could have come afterit.DON PEDROYea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night wewould have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.BALTHASARThe best I can, my lord.DON PEDRODo so: farewell.Exit BALTHASARCome hither, Leonato. What was it you told me ofto-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love withSignior Benedick?CLAUDIOO, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I didnever think that lady would have loved any man.LEONATONo, nor I neither; but most wonderful that sheshould so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath inall outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.BENEDICKIs't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?LEONATOBy my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to thinkof it but that she loves him with an enragedaffection: it is past the infinite of thought.DON PEDROMay be she doth but counterfeit.CLAUDIOFaith, like enough.LEONATOO God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit ofpassion came so near the life of passion as shediscovers it.DON PEDROWhy, what effects of passion shows she?CLAUDIOBait the hook well; this fish will bite.LEONATOWhat effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heardmy daughter tell you how.CLAUDIOShe did, indeed.DON PEDROHow, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have Ithought her spirit had been invincible against allassaults of affection.LEONATOI would have sworn it had, my lord; especiallyagainst Benedick.BENEDICKI should think this a gull, but that thewhite-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,sure, hide himself in such reverence.CLAUDIOHe hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.DON PEDROHath she made her affection known to Benedick?LEONATONo; and swears she never will: that's her torment.CLAUDIO'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'ShallI,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered himwith scorn, write to him that I love him?'LEONATOThis says she now when she is beginning to write tohim; for she'll be up twenty times a night, andthere will she sit in her smock till she have writ asheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.CLAUDIONow you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember apretty jest your daughter told us of.LEONATOO, when she had writ it and was reading it over, shefound Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?CLAUDIOThat.LEONATOO, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;railed at herself, that she should be so immodestto write to one that she knew would flout her; 'Imeasure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for Ishould flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though Ilove him, I should.'CLAUDIOThen down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'Osweet Benedick! God give me patience!'LEONATOShe doth indeed; my daughter says so: and theecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughteris sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrageto herself: it is very true.DON PEDROIt were good that Benedick knew of it by someother, if she will not discover it.CLAUDIOTo what end? He would make but a sport of it andtorment the poor lady worse.DON PEDROAn he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's anexcellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,she is virtuous.CLAUDIOAnd she is exceeding wise.DON PEDROIn every thing but in loving Benedick.LEONATOO, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tendera body, we have ten proofs to one that blood haththe victory. I am sorry for her, as I have justcause, being her uncle and her guardian.DON PEDROI would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I wouldhave daffed all other respects and made her halfmyself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hearwhat a' will say.LEONATOWere it good, think you?CLAUDIOHero thinks surely she will die; for she says shewill die, if he love her not, and she will die, ereshe make her love known, and she will die, if he wooher, rather than she will bate one breath of heraccustomed crossness.DON PEDROShe doth well: if she should make tender of herlove, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for theman, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.CLAUDIOHe is a very proper man.DON PEDROHe hath indeed a good outward happiness.CLAUDIOBefore God! and, in my mind, very wise.DON PEDROHe doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.CLAUDIOAnd I take him to be valiant.DON PEDROAs Hector, I assure you: and in the managing ofquarrels you may say he is wise; for either heavoids them with great discretion, or undertakesthem with a most Christian-like fear.LEONATOIf he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:if he break the peace, he ought to enter into aquarrel with fear and trembling.DON PEDROAnd so will he do; for the man doth fear God,howsoever it seems not in him by some large jestshe will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shallwe go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?CLAUDIONever tell him, my lord: let her wear it out withgood counsel.LEONATONay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.DON PEDROWell, we will hear further of it by your daughter:let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and Icould wish he would modestly examine himself, to seehow much he is unworthy so good a lady.LEONATOMy lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.CLAUDIOIf he do not dote on her upon this, I will nevertrust my expectation.DON PEDROLet there be the same net spread for her; and thatmust your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. Thesport will be, when they hold one an opinion ofanother's dotage, and no such matter: that's thescene that I would see, which will be merely adumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATOBENEDICK[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: theconference was sadly borne. They have the truth ofthis from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: itseems her affections have their full bent. Love me!why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceivethe love come from her; they say too that she willrather die than give any sign of affection. I didnever think to marry: I must not seem proud: happyare they that hear their detractions and can putthem to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis atruth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tisso, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for lovingme; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, norno great argument of her folly, for I will behorribly in love with her. I may chance have someodd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,because I have railed so long against marriage: butdoth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meatin his youth that he cannot endure in his age.Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets ofthe brain awe a man from the career of his humour?No, the world must be peopled. When I said I woulddie a bachelor, I did not think I should live till Iwere married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love inher.Enter BEATRICEBEATRICEAgainst my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.BENEDICKFair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.BEATRICEI took no more pains for those thanks than you takepains to thank me: if it had been painful, I wouldnot have come.BENEDICKYou take pleasure then in the message?BEATRICEYea, just so much as you may take upon a knife'spoint and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,signior: fare you well.ExitBENEDICKHa! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come into dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I tookno more pains for those thanks than you took painsto thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any painsthat I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I donot take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do notlove her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.ExitACT IIISCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULAHEROGood Margaret, run thee to the parlor;There shalt thou find my cousin BeatriceProposing with the prince and Claudio:Whisper her ear and tell her, I and UrsulaWalk in the orchard and our whole discourseIs all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;And bid her steal into the pleached bower,Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,Made proud by princes, that advance their prideAgainst that power that bred it: there will she hide her,To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.MARGARETI'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.ExitHERONow, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,As we do trace this alley up and down,Our talk must only be of Benedick.When I do name him, let it be thy partTo praise him more than ever man did merit:My talk to thee must be how BenedickIs sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matterIs little Cupid's crafty arrow made,That only wounds by hearsay.Enter BEATRICE, behindNow begin;For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runsClose by the ground, to hear our conference.URSULAThe pleasant'st angling is to see the fishCut with her golden oars the silver stream,And greedily devour the treacherous bait:So angle we for Beatrice; who even nowIs couched in the woodbine coverture.Fear you not my part of the dialogue.HEROThen go we near her, that her ear lose nothingOf the false sweet bait that we lay for it.Approaching the bowerNo, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;I know her spirits are as coy and wildAs haggerds of the rock.URSULABut are you sureThat Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?HEROSo says the prince and my new-trothed lord.URSULAAnd did they bid you tell her of it, madam?HEROThey did entreat me to acquaint her of it;But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,To wish him wrestle with affection,And never to let Beatrice know of it.URSULAWhy did you so? Doth not the gentlemanDeserve as full as fortunate a bedAs ever Beatrice shall couch upon?HEROO god of love! I know he doth deserveAs much as may be yielded to a man:But Nature never framed a woman's heartOf prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,Misprising what they look on, and her witValues itself so highly that to herAll matter else seems weak: she cannot love,Nor take no shape nor project of affection,She is so self-endeared.URSULASure, I think so;And therefore certainly it were not goodShe knew his love, lest she make sport at it.HEROWhy, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;If low, an agate very vilely cut;If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;If silent, why, a block moved with none.So turns she every man the wrong side outAnd never gives to truth and virtue thatWhich simpleness and merit purchaseth.URSULASure, sure, such carping is not commendable.HERONo, not to be so odd and from all fashionsAs Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh meOut of myself, press me to death with wit.Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:It were a better death than die with mocks,Which is as bad as die with tickling.URSULAYet tell her of it: hear what she will say.HERONo; rather I will go to BenedickAnd counsel him to fight against his passion.And, truly, I'll devise some honest slandersTo stain my cousin with: one doth not knowHow much an ill word may empoison liking.URSULAO, do not do your cousin such a wrong.She cannot be so much without true judgment--Having so swift and excellent a witAs she is prized to have--as to refuseSo rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.HEROHe is the only man of Italy.Always excepted my dear Claudio.URSULAI pray you, be not angry with me, madam,Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,Goes foremost in report through Italy.HEROIndeed, he hath an excellent good name.URSULAHis excellence did earn it, ere he had it.When are you married, madam?HEROWhy, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counselWhich is the best to furnish me to-morrow.URSULAShe's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.HEROIf it proves so, then loving goes by haps:Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.Exeunt HERO and URSULABEATRICE[Coming forward]What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!No glory lives behind the back of such.And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite theeTo bind our loves up in a holy band;For others say thou dost deserve, and IBelieve it better than reportingly.ExitSCENE II. A room in LEONATO'S houseEnter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATODON PEDROI do but stay till your marriage be consummate, andthen go I toward Arragon.CLAUDIOI'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'llvouchsafe me.DON PEDRONay, that would be as great a soil in the new glossof your marriage as to show a child his new coatand forbid him to wear it. I will only be boldwith Benedick for his company; for, from the crownof his head to the sole of his foot, he is allmirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid'sbow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot athim; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and histongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks histongue speaks.BENEDICKGallants, I am not as I have been.LEONATOSo say I	methinks you are sadder.CLAUDIOI hope he be in love.DON PEDROHang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood inhim, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,he wants money.BENEDICKI have the toothache.DON PEDRODraw it.BENEDICKHang it!CLAUDIOYou must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.DON PEDROWhat! sigh for the toothache?LEONATOWhere is but a humour or a worm.BENEDICKWell, every one can master a grief but he that hasit.CLAUDIOYet say I, he is in love.DON PEDROThere is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it bea fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to bea Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in theshape of two countries at once, as, a German fromthe waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard fromthe hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancyto this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is nofool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.CLAUDIOIf he be not in love with some woman, there is nobelieving old signs: a' brushes his hat o'mornings; what should that bode?DON PEDROHath any man seen him at the barber's?CLAUDIONo, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,and the old ornament of his cheek hath alreadystuffed tennis-balls.LEONATOIndeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.DON PEDRONay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell himout by that?CLAUDIOThat's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.DON PEDROThe greatest note of it is his melancholy.CLAUDIOAnd when was he wont to wash his face?DON PEDROYea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hearwhat they say of him.CLAUDIONay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept intoa lute-string and now governed by stops.DON PEDROIndeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,conclude he is in love.CLAUDIONay, but I know who loves him.DON PEDROThat would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.CLAUDIOYes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite ofall, dies for him.DON PEDROShe shall be buried with her face upwards.BENEDICKYet is this no charm for the toothache. Oldsignior, walk aside with me: I have studied eightor nine wise words to speak to you, which thesehobby-horses must not hear.Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATODON PEDROFor my life, to break with him about Beatrice.CLAUDIO'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by thisplayed their parts with Beatrice; and then the twobears will not bite one another when they meet.Enter DON JOHNDON JOHNMy lord and brother, God save you!DON PEDROGood den, brother.DON JOHNIf your leisure served, I would speak with you.DON PEDROIn private?DON JOHNIf it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; forwhat I would speak of concerns him.DON PEDROWhat's the matter?DON JOHN[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be marriedto-morrow?DON PEDROYou know he does.DON JOHNI know not that, when he knows what I know.CLAUDIOIf there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.DON JOHNYou may think I love you not: let that appearhereafter, and aim better at me by that I now willmanifest. For my brother, I think he holds youwell, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effectyour ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent andlabour ill bestowed.DON PEDROWhy, what's the matter?DON JOHNI came hither to tell you; and, circumstancesshortened, for she has been too long a talking of,the lady is disloyal.CLAUDIOWho, Hero?DON PEDROEven she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:CLAUDIODisloyal?DON JOHNThe word is too good to paint out her wickedness; Icould say she were worse: think you of a worsetitle, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not tillfurther warrant: go but with me to-night, you shallsee her chamber-window entered, even the nightbefore her wedding-day: if you love her then,to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honourto change your mind.CLAUDIOMay this be so?DON PEDROI will not think it.DON JOHNIf you dare not trust that you see, confess notthat you know: if you will follow me, I will showyou enough; and when you have seen more and heardmore, proceed accordingly.CLAUDIOIf I see any thing to-night why I should not marryher to-morrow in the congregation, where I shouldwed, there will I shame her.DON PEDROAnd, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will joinwith thee to disgrace her.DON JOHNI will disparage her no farther till you are mywitnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, andlet the issue show itself.DON PEDROO day untowardly turned!CLAUDIOO mischief strangely thwarting!DON JOHNO plague right well prevented! so will you say whenyou have seen the sequel.ExeuntSCENE III. A street.Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the WatchDOGBERRYAre you good men and true?VERGESYea, or else it were pity but they should suffersalvation, body and soul.DOGBERRYNay, that were a punishment too good for them, ifthey should have any allegiance in them, beingchosen for the prince's watch.VERGESWell, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.DOGBERRYFirst, who think you the most desertless man to beconstable?First WatchmanHugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they canwrite and read.DOGBERRYCome hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessedyou with a good name: to be a well-favoured man isthe gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.Second WatchmanBoth which, master constable,--DOGBERRYYou have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and makeno boast of it; and for your writing and reading,let that appear when there is no need of suchvanity. You are thought here to be the mostsenseless and fit man for the constable of thewatch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is yourcharge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you areto bid any man stand, in the prince's name.Second WatchmanHow if a' will not stand?DOGBERRYWhy, then, take no note of him, but let him go; andpresently call the rest of the watch together andthank God you are rid of a knave.VERGESIf he will not stand when he is bidden, he is noneof the prince's subjects.DOGBERRYTrue, and they are to meddle with none but theprince's subjects. You shall also make no noise inthe streets; for, for the watch to babble and totalk is most tolerable and not to be endured.WatchmanWe will rather sleep than talk: we know whatbelongs to a watch.DOGBERRYWhy, you speak like an ancient and most quietwatchman; for I cannot see how sleeping shouldoffend: only, have a care that your bills be notstolen. Well, you are to call at all theale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.WatchmanHow if they will not?DOGBERRYWhy, then, let them alone till they are sober: ifthey make you not then the better answer, you maysay they are not the men you took them for.WatchmanWell, sir.DOGBERRYIf you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtueof your office, to be no true man; and, for suchkind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,why the more is for your honesty.WatchmanIf we know him to be a thief, shall we not layhands on him?DOGBERRYTruly, by your office, you may; but I think theythat touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceableway for you, if you do take a thief, is to let himshow himself what he is and steal out of your company.VERGESYou have been always called a merciful man, partner.DOGBERRYTruly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much morea man who hath any honesty in him.VERGESIf you hear a child cry in the night, you must callto the nurse and bid her still it.WatchmanHow if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?DOGBERRYWhy, then, depart in peace, and let the child wakeher with crying; for the ewe that will not hear herlamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.VERGES'Tis very true.DOGBERRYThis is the end of the charge:--you, constable, areto present the prince's own person: if you meet theprince in the night, you may stay him.VERGESNay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.DOGBERRYFive shillings to one on't, with any man that knowsthe statutes, he may stay him: marry, not withoutthe prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch oughtto offend no man; and it is an offence to stay aman against his will.VERGESBy'r lady, I think it be so.DOGBERRYHa, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there beany matter of weight chances, call up me: keep yourfellows' counsels and your own; and good night.Come, neighbour.WatchmanWell, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit hereupon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.DOGBERRYOne word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watchabout Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding beingthere to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGESEnter BORACHIO and CONRADEBORACHIOWhat Conrade!Watchman[Aside]  Peace! stir not.BORACHIOConrade, I say!CONRADEHere, man; I am at thy elbow.BORACHIOMass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would ascab follow.CONRADEI will owe thee an answer for that: and now forwardwith thy tale.BORACHIOStand thee close, then, under this pent-house, forit drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,utter all to thee.Watchman[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.BORACHIOTherefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.CONRADEIs it possible that any villany should be so dear?BORACHIOThou shouldst rather ask if it were possible anyvillany should be so rich; for when rich villainshave need of poor ones, poor ones may make whatprice they will.CONRADEI wonder at it.BORACHIOThat shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest thatthe fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, isnothing to a man.CONRADEYes, it is apparel.BORACHIOI mean, the fashion.CONRADEYes, the fashion is the fashion.BORACHIOTush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. Butseest thou not what a deformed thief this fashionis?Watchman[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vilethief this seven year; a' goes up and down like agentleman: I remember his name.BORACHIODidst thou not hear somebody?CONRADENo; 'twas the vane on the house.BORACHIOSeest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief thisfashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hotbloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiersin the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel'spriests in the old church-window, sometime like theshaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?CONRADEAll this I see; and I see that the fashion wearsout more apparel than the man. But art not thouthyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hastshifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?BORACHIONot so, neither: but know that I have to-nightwooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by thename of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'chamber-window, bids me a thousand times goodnight,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should firsttell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,planted and placed and possessed by my master DonJohn, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.CONRADEAnd thought they Margaret was Hero?BORACHIOTwo of them did, the prince and Claudio; but thedevil my master knew she was Margaret; and partlyby his oaths, which first possessed them, partly bythe dark night, which did deceive them, but chieflyby my villany, which did confirm any slander thatDon John had made, away went Claudio enraged; sworehe would meet her, as he was appointed, next morningat the temple, and there, before the wholecongregation, shame her with what he saw o'er nightand send her home again without a husband.First WatchmanWe charge you, in the prince's name, stand!Second WatchmanCall up the right master constable. We have hererecovered the most dangerous piece of lechery thatever was known in the commonwealth.First WatchmanAnd one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'wears a lock.CONRADEMasters, masters,--Second WatchmanYou'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.CONRADEMasters,--First WatchmanNever speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.BORACHIOWe are like to prove a goodly commodity, being takenup of these men's bills.CONRADEA commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.ExeuntSCENE IV.

I saw the Duchess of Milan'sgown that they praise so.HEROO, that exceeds, they say.MARGARETBy my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect ofyours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced withsilver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellentfashion, yours is worth ten on 't.HEROGod give me joy to wear it! for my heart isexceeding heavy.MARGARET'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.HEROFie upon thee! art not ashamed?MARGARETOf what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is notmarriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lordhonourable without marriage? I think you would haveme say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and badthinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offendnobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for ahusband'? None, I think, and it be the right husbandand the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and notheavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.Enter BEATRICEHEROGood morrow, coz.BEATRICEGood morrow, sweet Hero.HEROWhy how now? do you speak in the sick tune?BEATRICEI am out of all other tune, methinks.MARGARETClap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without aburden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.BEATRICEYe light o' love, with your heels! then, if yourhusband have stables enough, you'll see he shalllack no barns.MARGARETO illegitimate construction!

By my troth, I am sick.MARGARETGet you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.HEROThere thou prickest her with a thistle.BEATRICEBenedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral inthis Benedictus.MARGARETMoral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; Imeant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchancethat I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I amnot such a fool to think what I list, nor I listnot to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,if I would think my heart out of thinking, that youare in love or that you will be in love or that youcan be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, andnow is he become a man: he swore he would nevermarry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eatshis meat without grudging: and how you may beconverted I know not, but methinks you look withyour eyes as other women do.BEATRICEWhat pace is this that thy tongue keeps?MARGARETNot a false gallop.Re-enter URSULAURSULAMadam, withdraw: the prince, the count, SigniorBenedick, Don John, and all the gallants of thetown, are come to fetch you to church.HEROHelp to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.ExeuntSCENE V. Another room in LEONATO'S house.Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGESLEONATOWhat would you with me, honest neighbour?DOGBERRYMarry, sir, I would have some confidence with youthat decerns you nearly.LEONATOBrief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.DOGBERRYMarry, this it is, sir.VERGESYes, in truth it is, sir.LEONATOWhat is it, my good friends?DOGBERRYGoodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off thematter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not soblunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.VERGESYes, I thank God I am as honest as any man livingthat is an old man and no honester than I.DOGBERRYComparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.LEONATONeighbours, you are tedious.DOGBERRYIt pleases your worship to say so, but we are thepoor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it inmy heart to bestow it all of your worship.LEONATOAll thy tediousness on me, ah?DOGBERRYYea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; forI hear as good exclamation on your worship as of anyman in the city; and though I be but a poor man, Iam glad to hear it.VERGESAnd so am I.LEONATOI would fain know what you have to say.VERGESMarry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting yourworship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrantknaves as any in Messina.DOGBERRYA good old man, sir; he will be talking: as theysay, when the age is in, the wit is out: God helpus! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two menride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honestsoul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as everbroke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all menare not alike; alas, good neighbour!LEONATOIndeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.DOGBERRYGifts that God gives.LEONATOI must leave you.DOGBERRYOne word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeedcomprehended two aspicious persons, and we wouldhave them this morning examined before your worship.LEONATOTake their examination yourself and bring it me: Iam now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.DOGBERRYIt shall be suffigance.LEONATODrink some wine ere you go: fare you well.Enter a MessengerMessengerMy lord, they stay for you to give your daughter toher husband.LEONATOI'll wait upon them: I am ready.Exeunt LEONATO and MessengerDOGBERRYGo, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: weare now to examination these men.VERGESAnd we must do it wisely.DOGBERRYWe will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here'sthat shall drive some of them to a non-come: onlyget the learned writer to set down ourexcommunication and meet me at the gaol.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I. A church.Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and AttendantsLEONATOCome, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plainform of marriage, and you shall recount theirparticular duties afterwards.FRIAR FRANCISYou come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.CLAUDIONo.LEONATOTo be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.FRIAR FRANCISLady, you come hither to be married to this count.HEROI do.FRIAR FRANCISIf either of you know any inward impediment why youshould not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,to utter it.CLAUDIOKnow you any, Hero?HERONone, my lord.FRIAR FRANCISKnow you any, count?LEONATOI dare make his answer, none.CLAUDIOO, what men dare do! what men may do! what men dailydo, not knowing what they do!BENEDICKHow now! interjections? Why, then, some be oflaughing, as, ah, ha, he!CLAUDIOStand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:Will you with free and unconstrained soulGive me this maid, your daughter?LEONATOAs freely, son, as God did give her me.CLAUDIOAnd what have I to give you back, whose worthMay counterpoise this rich and precious gift?DON PEDRONothing, unless you render her again.CLAUDIOSweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.There, Leonato, take her back again:Give not this rotten orange to your friend;She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.Behold how like a maid she blushes here!O, what authority and show of truthCan cunning sin cover itself withal!Comes not that blood as modest evidenceTo witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,All you that see her, that she were a maid,By these exterior shows? But she is none:She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.LEONATOWhat do you mean, my lord?CLAUDIONot to be married,Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.LEONATODear my lord, if you, in your own proof,Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,And made defeat of her virginity,--CLAUDIOI know what you would say: if I have known her,You will say she did embrace me as a husband,And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:No, Leonato,I never tempted her with word too large;But, as a brother to his sister, show'dBashful sincerity and comely love.HEROAnd seem'd I ever otherwise to you?CLAUDIOOut on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:You seem to me as Dian in her orb,As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;But you are more intemperate in your bloodThan Venus, or those pamper'd animalsThat rage in savage sensuality.HEROIs my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?LEONATOSweet prince, why speak not you?DON PEDROWhat should I speak?I stand dishonour'd, that have gone aboutTo link my dear friend to a common stale.LEONATOAre these things spoken, or do I but dream?DON JOHNSir, they are spoken, and these things are true.BENEDICKThis looks not like a nuptial.HEROTrue! O God!CLAUDIOLeonato, stand I here?Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?LEONATOAll this is so: but what of this, my lord?CLAUDIOLet me but move one question to your daughter;And, by that fatherly and kindly powerThat you have in her, bid her answer truly.LEONATOI charge thee do so, as thou art my child.HEROO, God defend me! how am I beset!What kind of catechising call you this?CLAUDIOTo make you answer truly to your name.HEROIs it not Hero? Who can blot that nameWith any just reproach?CLAUDIOMarry, that can Hero;Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.What man was he talk'd with you yesternightOut at your window betwixt twelve and one?Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.HEROI talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.DON PEDROWhy, then are you no maiden. Leonato,I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,Myself, my brother and this grieved countDid see her, hear her, at that hour last nightTalk with a ruffian at her chamber-windowWho hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,Confess'd the vile encounters they have hadA thousand times in secret.DON JOHNFie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,Not to be spoke of;There is not chastity enough in languageWithout offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.CLAUDIOO Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,If half thy outward graces had been placedAbout thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,Thou pure impiety and impious purity!For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,And never shall it more be gracious.LEONATOHath no man's dagger here a point for me?HERO swoonsBEATRICEWhy, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?DON JOHNCome, let us go. These things, come thus to light,Smother her spirits up.Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIOBENEDICKHow doth the lady?BEATRICEDead, I think. Help, uncle!Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!LEONATOO Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.Death is the fairest cover for her shameThat may be wish'd for.BEATRICEHow now, cousin Hero!FRIAR FRANCISHave comfort, lady.LEONATODost thou look up?FRIAR FRANCISYea, wherefore should she not?LEONATOWherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thingCry shame upon her? Could she here denyThe story that is printed in her blood?Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?Why had I not with charitable handTook up a beggar's issue at my gates,Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,I might have said 'No part of it is mine;This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?But mine and mine I loved and mine I praisedAnd mine that I was proud on, mine so muchThat I myself was to myself not mine,Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallenInto a pit of ink, that the wide seaHath drops too few to wash her clean againAnd salt too little which may season giveTo her foul-tainted flesh!BENEDICKSir, sir, be patient.For my part, I am so attired in wonder,I know not what to say.BEATRICEO, on my soul, my cousin is belied!BENEDICKLady, were you her bedfellow last night?BEATRICENo, truly not; although, until last night,I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.LEONATOConfirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger madeWhich was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.FRIAR FRANCISHear me a little;For I have only been silent so longAnd given way unto this course of fortune....By noting of the lady I have mark'dA thousand blushing apparitionsTo start into her face, a thousand innocent shamesIn angel whiteness beat away those blushes;And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,To burn the errors that these princes holdAgainst her maiden truth. Call me a fool;Trust not my reading nor my observations,Which with experimental seal doth warrantThe tenor of my book; trust not my age,My reverence, calling, nor divinity,If this sweet lady lie not guiltless hereUnder some biting error.LEONATOFriar, it cannot be.Thou seest that all the grace that she hath leftIs that she will not add to her damnationA sin of perjury; she not denies it:Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuseThat which appears in proper nakedness?FRIAR FRANCISLady, what man is he you are accused of?HEROThey know that do accuse me; I know none:If I know more of any man aliveThan that which maiden modesty doth warrant,Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,Prove you that any man with me conversedAt hours unmeet, or that I yesternightMaintain'd the change of words with any creature,Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!FRIAR FRANCISThere is some strange misprision in the princes.BENEDICKTwo of them have the very bent of honour;And if their wisdoms be misled in this,The practise of it lives in John the bastard,Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.LEONATOI know not. If they speak but truth of her,These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,The proudest of them shall well hear of it.Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,Nor age so eat up my invention,Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,Both strength of limb and policy of mind,Ability in means and choice of friends,To quit me of them throughly.FRIAR FRANCISPause awhile,And let my counsel sway you in this case.Your daughter here the princes left for dead:Let her awhile be secretly kept in,And publish it that she is dead indeed;Maintain a mourning ostentationAnd on your family's old monumentHang mournful epitaphs and do all ritesThat appertain unto a burial.LEONATOWhat shall become of this? what will this do?FRIAR FRANCISMarry, this well carried shall on her behalfChange slander to remorse; that is some good:But not for that dream I on this strange course,But on this travail look for greater birth.She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,Upon the instant that she was accused,Shall be lamented, pitied and excusedOf every hearer: for it so falls outThat what we have we prize not to the worthWhiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,Why, then we rack the value, then we findThe virtue that possession would not show usWhiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:When he shall hear she died upon his words,The idea of her life shall sweetly creepInto his study of imagination,And every lovely organ of her lifeShall come apparell'd in more precious habit,More moving-delicate and full of life,Into the eye and prospect of his soul,Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,If ever love had interest in his liver,And wish he had not so accused her,No, though he thought his accusation true.Let this be so, and doubt not but successWill fashion the event in better shapeThan I can lay it down in likelihood.But if all aim but this be levell'd false,The supposition of the lady's deathWill quench the wonder of her infamy:And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,As best befits her wounded reputation,In some reclusive and religious life,Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.BENEDICKSignior Leonato, let the friar advise you:And though you know my inwardness and loveIs very much unto the prince and Claudio,Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in thisAs secretly and justly as your soulShould with your body.LEONATOBeing that I flow in grief,The smallest twine may lead me.FRIAR FRANCIS'Tis well consented: presently away;For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-dayPerhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICEBENEDICKLady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?BEATRICEYea, and I will weep a while longer.BENEDICKI will not desire that.BEATRICEYou have no reason; I do it freely.BENEDICKSurely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.BEATRICEAh, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!BENEDICKIs there any way to show such friendship?BEATRICEA very even way, but no such friend.BENEDICKMay a man do it?BEATRICEIt is a man's office, but not yours.BENEDICKI do love nothing in the world so well as you: isnot that strange?BEATRICEAs strange as the thing I know not. It were aspossible for me to say I loved nothing so well asyou: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; Iconfess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.BENEDICKBy my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.BEATRICEDo not swear, and eat it.BENEDICKI will swear by it that you love me; and I will makehim eat it that says I love not you.BEATRICEWill you not eat your word?BENEDICKWith no sauce that can be devised to it. I protestI love thee.BEATRICEWhy, then, God forgive me!BENEDICKWhat offence, sweet Beatrice?BEATRICEYou have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about toprotest I loved you.BENEDICKAnd do it with all thy heart.BEATRICEI love you with so much of my heart that none isleft to protest.BENEDICKCome, bid me do any thing for thee.BEATRICEKill Claudio.BENEDICKHa! not for the wide world.BEATRICEYou kill me to deny it. Farewell.BENEDICKTarry, sweet Beatrice.BEATRICEI am gone, though I am here: there is no love inyou: nay, I pray you, let me go.BENEDICKBeatrice,--BEATRICEIn faith, I will go.BENEDICKWe'll be friends first.BEATRICEYou dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.BENEDICKIs Claudio thine enemy?BEATRICEIs he not approved in the height a villain, thathath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? Othat I were a man! What, bear her in hand until theycome to take hands; and then, with publicaccusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heartin the market-place.BENEDICKHear me, Beatrice,--BEATRICETalk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!BENEDICKNay, but, Beatrice,--BEATRICESweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.BENEDICKBeat--BEATRICEPrinces and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that Ihad any friend would be a man for my sake! Butmanhood is melted into courtesies, valour intocompliment, and men are only turned into tongue, andtrim ones too: he is now as valiant as Herculesthat only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be aman with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.BENEDICKTarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.BEATRICEUse it for my love some other way than swearing by it.BENEDICKThink you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?BEATRICEYea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.BENEDICKEnough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I willkiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,Claudio shall render me a dear account. As youhear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort yourcousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.ExeuntSCENE II.

Let the watchcome forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince'sname, accuse these men.First WatchmanThis man said, sir, that Don John, the prince'sbrother, was a villain.DOGBERRYWrite down Prince John a villain.

No, thou villain, thou art full ofpiety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,and, which is more, a householder, and, which ismore, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is inMessina, and one that knows the law, go to; and arich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hathhad losses, and one that hath two gowns and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O thatI had been writ down an ass!ExeuntACT VSCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.Enter LEONATO and ANTONIOANTONIOIf you go on thus, you will kill yourself:And 'tis not wisdom thus to second griefAgainst yourself.LEONATOI pray thee, cease thy counsel,Which falls into mine ears as profitlessAs water in a sieve: give not me counsel;Nor let no comforter delight mine earBut such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.Bring me a father that so loved his child,Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,And bid him speak of patience;Measure his woe the length and breadth of mineAnd let it answer every strain for strain,As thus for thus and such a grief for such,In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunkWith candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,And I of him will gather patience.But there is no such man: for, brother, menCan counsel and speak comfort to that griefWhich they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,Their counsel turns to passion, which beforeWould give preceptial medicine to rage,Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,Charm ache with air and agony with words:No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patienceTo those that wring under the load of sorrow,But no man's virtue nor sufficiencyTo be so moral when he shall endureThe like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:My griefs cry louder than advertisement.ANTONIOTherein do men from children nothing differ.LEONATOI pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;For there was never yet philosopherThat could endure the toothache patiently,However they have writ the style of godsAnd made a push at chance and sufferance.ANTONIOYet bend not all the harm upon yourself;Make those that do offend you suffer too.LEONATOThere thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;And that shall Claudio know; so shall the princeAnd all of them that thus dishonour her.ANTONIOHere comes the prince and Claudio hastily.Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIODON PEDROGood den, good den.CLAUDIOGood day to both of you.LEONATOHear you. my lords,--DON PEDROWe have some haste, Leonato.LEONATOSome haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.DON PEDRONay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.ANTONIOIf he could right himself with quarreling,Some of us would lie low.CLAUDIOWho wrongs him?LEONATOMarry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;I fear thee not.CLAUDIOMarry, beshrew my hand,If it should give your age such cause of fear:In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.LEONATOTush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,As under privilege of age to bragWhat I have done being young, or what would doWere I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and meThat I am forced to lay my reverence byAnd, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,Do challenge thee to trial of a man.I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,And she lies buried with her ancestors;O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!CLAUDIOMy villany?LEONATOThine, Claudio; thine, I say.DON PEDROYou say not right, old man.LEONATOMy lord, my lord,I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,Despite his nice fence and his active practise,His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.CLAUDIOAway! I will not have to do with you.LEONATOCanst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.ANTONIOHe shall kill two of us, and men indeed:But that's no matter; let him kill one first;Win me and wear me; let him answer me.Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.LEONATOBrother,--ANTONIOContent yourself. God knows I loved my niece;And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,That dare as well answer a man indeedAs I dare take a serpent by the tongue:Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!LEONATOBrother Antony,--ANTONIOHold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,Go anticly, show outward hideousness,And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;And this is all.LEONATOBut, brother Antony,--ANTONIOCome, 'tis no matter:Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.DON PEDROGentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:But, on my honour, she was charged with nothingBut what was true and very full of proof.LEONATOMy lord, my lord,--DON PEDROI will not hear you.LEONATONo? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.ANTONIOAnd shall, or some of us will smart for it.Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIODON PEDROSee, see; here comes the man we went to seek.Enter BENEDICKCLAUDIONow, signior, what news?BENEDICKGood day, my lord.DON PEDROWelcome, signior: you are almost come to partalmost a fray.CLAUDIOWe had like to have had our two noses snapped offwith two old men without teeth.DON PEDROLeonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Hadwe fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.BENEDICKIn a false quarrel there is no true valour. I cameto seek you both.CLAUDIOWe have been up and down to seek thee; for we arehigh-proof melancholy and would fain have it beatenaway. Wilt thou use thy wit?BENEDICKIt is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?DON PEDRODost thou wear thy wit by thy side?CLAUDIONever any did so, though very many have been besidetheir wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do theminstrels; draw, to pleasure us.DON PEDROAs I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thousick, or angry?CLAUDIOWhat, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.BENEDICKSir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and youcharge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.CLAUDIONay, then, give him another staff: this last wasbroke cross.DON PEDROBy this light, he changes more and more: I thinkhe be angry indeed.CLAUDIOIf he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.BENEDICKShall I speak a word in your ear?CLAUDIOGod bless me from a challenge!BENEDICK[Aside to CLAUDIO]  You are a villain; I jest not:I will make it good how you dare, with what youdare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I willprotest your cowardice. You have killed a sweetlady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let mehear from you.CLAUDIOWell, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.DON PEDROWhat, a feast, a feast?CLAUDIOI' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf'shead and a capon; the which if I do not carve mostcuriously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not finda woodcock too?BENEDICKSir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.DON PEDROI'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit theother day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'agreat wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.''Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'ithurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentlemanis wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.''Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That Ibelieve,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me onMonday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thusdid she, an hour together, transshape thy particularvirtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thouwast the properest man in Italy.CLAUDIOFor the which she wept heartily and said she carednot.DON PEDROYea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if shedid not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:the old man's daughter told us all.CLAUDIOAll, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he washid in the garden.DON PEDROBut when shall we set the savage bull's horns onthe sensible Benedick's head?CLAUDIOYea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick themarried man'?BENEDICKFare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leaveyou now to your gossip-like humour: you break jestsas braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thankyou: I must discontinue your company: your brotherthe bastard is fled from Messina: you have amongyou killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my LordLackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, tillthen, peace be with him.ExitDON PEDROHe is in earnest.CLAUDIOIn most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, forthe love of Beatrice.DON PEDROAnd hath challenged thee.CLAUDIOMost sincerely.DON PEDROWhat a pretty thing man is when he goes in hisdoublet and hose and leaves off his wit!CLAUDIOHe is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape adoctor to such a man.DON PEDROBut, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, andbe sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIODOGBERRYCome you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, sheshall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.DON PEDROHow now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachioone!CLAUDIOHearken after their offence, my lord.DON PEDROOfficers, what offence have these men done?DOGBERRYMarry, sir, they have committed false report;moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they havebelied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjustthings; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.DON PEDROFirst, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, Iask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, whythey are committed; and, to conclude, what you layto their charge.CLAUDIORightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, bymy troth, there's one meaning well suited.DON PEDROWho have you offended, masters, that you are thusbound to your answer? this learned constable istoo cunning to be understood: what's your offence?BORACHIOSweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I havedeceived even your very eyes: what your wisdomscould not discover, these shallow fools have broughtto light: who in the night overheard me confessingto this man how Don John your brother incensed meto slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought intothe orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero'sgarments, how you disgraced her, when you shouldmarry her: my villany they have upon record; whichI had rather seal with my death than repeat overto my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and mymaster's false accusation; and, briefly, I desirenothing but the reward of a villain.DON PEDRORuns not this speech like iron through your blood?CLAUDIOI have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.DON PEDROBut did my brother set thee on to this?BORACHIOYea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.DON PEDROHe is composed and framed of treachery:And fled he is upon this villany.CLAUDIOSweet Hero! now thy image doth appearIn the rare semblance that I loved it first.DOGBERRYCome, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time oursexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:and, masters, do not forget to specify, when timeand place shall serve, that I am an ass.VERGESHere, here comes master Signior Leonato, and theSexton too.Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the SextonLEONATOWhich is the villain? let me see his eyes,That, when I note another man like him,I may avoid him: which of these is he?BORACHIOIf you would know your wronger, look on me.LEONATOArt thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'dMine innocent child?BORACHIOYea, even I alone.LEONATONo, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:Here stand a pair of honourable men;A third is fled, that had a hand in it.I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:Record it with your high and worthy deeds:'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.CLAUDIOI know not how to pray your patience;Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;Impose me to what penance your inventionCan lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I notBut in mistaking.DON PEDROBy my soul, nor I:And yet, to satisfy this good old man,I would bend under any heavy weightThat he'll enjoin me to.LEONATOI cannot bid you bid my daughter live;That were impossible: but, I pray you both,Possess the people in Messina hereHow innocent she died; and if your loveCan labour ought in sad invention,Hang her an epitaph upon her tombAnd sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:To-morrow morning come you to my house,And since you could not be my son-in-law,Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,Almost the copy of my child that's dead,And she alone is heir to both of us:Give her the right you should have given her cousin,And so dies my revenge.CLAUDIOO noble sir,Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!I do embrace your offer; and disposeFor henceforth of poor Claudio.LEONATOTo-morrow then I will expect your coming;To-night I take my leave. This naughty manShall face to face be brought to Margaret,Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,Hired to it by your brother.BORACHIONo, by my soul, she was not,Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,But always hath been just and virtuousIn any thing that I do know by her.DOGBERRYMoreover, sir, which indeed is not under white andblack, this plaintiff here, the offender, did callme ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in hispunishment. And also, the watch heard them talk ofone Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear anda lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God'sname, the which he hath used so long and never paidthat now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothingfor God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.LEONATOI thank thee for thy care and honest pains.DOGBERRYYour worship speaks like a most thankful andreverend youth; and I praise God for you.LEONATOThere's for thy pains.DOGBERRYGod save the foundation!LEONATOGo, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.DOGBERRYI leave an arrant knave with your worship; which Ibeseech your worship to correct yourself, for theexample of others. God keep your worship! I wishyour worship well; God restore you to health! Ihumbly give you leave to depart; and if a merrymeeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGESLEONATOUntil to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.ANTONIOFarewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.DON PEDROWe will not fail.CLAUDIOTo-night I'll mourn with Hero.LEONATO[To the Watch]  Bring you these fellows on. We'lltalk with Margaret,How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.Exeunt, severallySCENE II. LEONATO'S garden.Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meetingBENEDICKPray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well atmy hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.MARGARETWill you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?BENEDICKIn so high a style, Margaret, that no man livingshall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thoudeservest it.MARGARETTo have no man come over me! why, shall I alwayskeep below stairs?BENEDICKThy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.MARGARETAnd yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,but hurt not.BENEDICKA most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt awoman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I givethee the bucklers.MARGARETGive us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.BENEDICKIf you use them, Margaret, you must put in thepikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.MARGARETWell, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.BENEDICKAnd therefore will come.Exit MARGARETSingsThe god of love,That sits above,And knows me, and knows me,How pitiful I deserve,--I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the goodswimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, anda whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of ablank verse, why, they were never so truly turnedover and over as my poor self in love. Marry, Icannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can findout no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocentrhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominousendings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,nor I cannot woo in festival terms.Enter BEATRICESweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?BEATRICEYea, signior, and depart when you bid me.BENEDICKO, stay but till then!BEATRICE'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ereI go, let me go with that I came; which is, withknowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.BENEDICKOnly foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.BEATRICEFoul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is butfoul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore Iwill depart unkissed.BENEDICKThou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell theeplainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and eitherI must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribehim a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me forwhich of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?BEATRICEFor them all together; which maintained so politica state of evil that they will not admit any goodpart to intermingle with them. But for which of mygood parts did you first suffer love for me?BENEDICKSuffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer loveindeed, for I love thee against my will.BEATRICEIn spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it foryours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.BENEDICKThou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.BEATRICEIt appears not in this confession: there's not onewise man among twenty that will praise himself.BENEDICKAn old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived inthe lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erectin this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall liveno longer in monument than the bell rings and thewidow weeps.BEATRICEAnd how long is that, think you?BENEDICKQuestion: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter inrheum: therefore is it most expedient for thewise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find noimpediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of hisown virtues, as I am to myself. So much forpraising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, ispraiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?BEATRICEVery ill.BENEDICKAnd how do you?BEATRICEVery ill too.BENEDICKServe God, love me and mend. There will I leaveyou too, for here comes one in haste.Enter URSULAURSULAMadam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's oldcoil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath beenfalsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightilyabused; and Don John is the author of all, who isfed and gone. Will you come presently?BEATRICEWill you go hear this news, signior?BENEDICKI will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and beburied in thy eyes; and moreover I will go withthee to thy uncle's.ExeuntSCENE III. A church.Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapersCLAUDIOIs this the monument of Leonato?LordIt is, my lord.CLAUDIO[Reading out of a scroll]Done to death by slanderous tonguesWas the Hero that here lies:Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,Gives her fame which never dies.So the life that died with shameLives in death with glorious fame.Hang thou there upon the tomb,Praising her when I am dumb.Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.SONG.Pardon, goddess of the night,Those that slew thy virgin knight;For the which, with songs of woe,Round about her tomb they go.Midnight, assist our moan;Help us to sigh and groan,Heavily, heavily:Graves, yawn and yield your dead,Till death be uttered,Heavily, heavily.CLAUDIONow, unto thy bones good night!Yearly will I do this rite.DON PEDROGood morrow, masters; put your torches out:The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,Before the wheels of Phoebus, round aboutDapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.CLAUDIOGood morrow, masters: each his several way.DON PEDROCome, let us hence, and put on other weeds;And then to Leonato's we will go.CLAUDIOAnd Hymen now with luckier issue speed'sThan this for whom we render'd up this woe.ExeuntSCENE IV.

You know your office, brother:You must be father to your brother's daughterAnd give her to young Claudio.ANTONIOWhich I will do with confirm'd countenance.BENEDICKFriar, I must entreat your pains, I think.FRIAR FRANCISTo do what, signior?BENEDICKTo bind me, or undo me; one of them.Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.LEONATOThat eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.BENEDICKAnd I do with an eye of love requite her.LEONATOThe sight whereof I think you had from me,From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?BENEDICKYour answer, sir, is enigmatical:But, for my will, my will is your good willMay stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'dIn the state of honourable marriage:In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.LEONATOMy heart is with your liking.FRIAR FRANCISAnd my help.Here comes the prince and Claudio.Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three othersDON PEDROGood morrow to this fair assembly.LEONATOGood morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:We here attend you. Are you yet determinedTo-day to marry with my brother's daughter?CLAUDIOI'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.LEONATOCall her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.Exit ANTONIODON PEDROGood morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,That you have such a February face,So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?CLAUDIOI think he thinks upon the savage bull.Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with goldAnd all Europa shall rejoice at thee,As once Europa did at lusty Jove,When he would play the noble beast in love.BENEDICKBull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,And got a calf in that same noble featMuch like to you, for you have just his bleat.CLAUDIOFor this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies maskedWhich is the lady I must seize upon?ANTONIOThis same is she, and I do give you her.CLAUDIOWhy, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.LEONATONo, that you shall not, till you take her handBefore this friar and swear to marry her.CLAUDIOGive me your hand: before this holy friar,I am your husband, if you like of me.HEROAnd when I lived, I was your other wife:UnmaskingAnd when you loved, you were my other husband.CLAUDIOAnother Hero!HERONothing certainer:One Hero died defiled, but I do live,And surely as I live, I am a maid.DON PEDROThe former Hero! Hero that is dead!LEONATOShe died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.FRIAR FRANCISAll this amazement can I qualify:When after that the holy rites are ended,I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:Meantime let wonder seem familiar,And to the chapel let us presently.BENEDICKSoft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?BEATRICE[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?BENEDICKDo not you love me?BEATRICEWhy, no; no more than reason.BENEDICKWhy, then your uncle and the prince and ClaudioHave been deceived; they swore you did.BEATRICEDo not you love me?BENEDICKTroth, no; no more than reason.BEATRICEWhy, then my cousin Margaret and UrsulaAre much deceived; for they did swear you did.BENEDICKThey swore that you were almost sick for me.BEATRICEThey swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.BENEDICK'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?BEATRICENo, truly, but in friendly recompense.LEONATOCome, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.CLAUDIOAnd I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;For here's a paper written in his hand,A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,Fashion'd to Beatrice.HEROAnd here's anotherWrit in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,Containing her affection unto Benedick.BENEDICKA miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I takethee for pity.BEATRICEI would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yieldupon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,for I was told you were in a consumption.BENEDICKPeace! I will stop your mouth.Kissing herDON PEDROHow dost thou, Benedick, the married man?BENEDICKI'll tell thee what, prince; a college ofwit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dostthou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wearnothing handsome about him. In brief, since I dopurpose to marry, I will think nothing to anypurpose that the world can say against it; andtherefore never flout at me for what I have saidagainst it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is myconclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think tohave beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be mykinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.CLAUDIOI had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy singlelife, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out ofquestion, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not lookexceedingly narrowly to thee.BENEDICKCome, come, we are friends: let's have a dance erewe are married, that we may lighten our own heartsand our wives' heels.LEONATOWe'll have dancing afterward.BENEDICKFirst, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.Enter a MessengerMessengerMy lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,And brought with armed men back to Messina.BENEDICKThink not on him till to-morrow:I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.Strike up, pipers.DanceExeunt
