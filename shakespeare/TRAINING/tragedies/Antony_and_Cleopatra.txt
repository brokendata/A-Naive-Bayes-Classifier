ACT ISCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILOPHILONay, but this dotage of our general'sO'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,That o'er the files and musters of the warHave glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,The office and devotion of their viewUpon a tawny front: his captain's heart,Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burstThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,And is become the bellows and the fanTo cool a gipsy's lust.Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning herLook, where they come:Take but good note, and you shall see in him.The triple pillar of the world transform'dInto a strumpet's fool: behold and see.CLEOPATRAIf it be love indeed, tell me how much.MARK ANTONYThere's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.CLEOPATRAI'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.MARK ANTONYThen must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.Enter an AttendantAttendantNews, my good lord, from Rome.MARK ANTONYGrates me: the sum.CLEOPATRANay, hear them, Antony:Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knowsIf the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sentHis powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'MARK ANTONYHow, my love!CLEOPATRAPerchance! nay, and most like:You must not stay here longer, your dismissionIs come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thineIs Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shameWhen shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!MARK ANTONYLet Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide archOf the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alikeFeeds beast as man: the nobleness of lifeIs to do thus; when such a mutual pairEmbracingAnd such a twain can do't, in which I bind,On pain of punishment, the world to weetWe stand up peerless.CLEOPATRAExcellent falsehood!Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?I'll seem the fool I am not; AntonyWill be himself.MARK ANTONYBut stirr'd by Cleopatra.Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:There's not a minute of our lives should stretchWithout some pleasure now. What sport tonight?CLEOPATRAHear the ambassadors.MARK ANTONYFie, wrangling queen!Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,To weep; whose every passion fully strivesTo make itself, in thee, fair and admired!No messenger, but thine; and all aloneTo-night we'll wander through the streets and noteThe qualities of people. Come, my queen;Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their trainDEMETRIUSIs Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?PHILOSir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,He comes too short of that great propertyWhich still should go with Antony.DEMETRIUSI am full sorryThat he approves the common liar, whoThus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hopeOf better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!ExeuntSCENE II. The same. Another room.Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SoothsayerCHARMIANLord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayerthat you praised so to the queen? O, that I knewthis husband, which, you say, must charge his hornswith garlands!ALEXASSoothsayer!SoothsayerYour will?CHARMIANIs this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?SoothsayerIn nature's infinite book of secrecyA little I can read.ALEXASShow him your hand.Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSDOMITIUS ENOBARBUSBring in the banquet quickly; wine enoughCleopatra's health to drink.CHARMIANGood sir, give me good fortune.SoothsayerI make not, but foresee.CHARMIANPray, then, foresee me one.SoothsayerYou shall be yet far fairer than you are.CHARMIANHe means in flesh.IRASNo, you shall paint when you are old.CHARMIANWrinkles forbid!ALEXASVex not his prescience; be attentive.CHARMIANHush!SoothsayerYou shall be more beloving than beloved.CHARMIANI had rather heat my liver with drinking.ALEXASNay, hear him.CHARMIANGood now, some excellent fortune! Let me be marriedto three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewrymay do homage: find me to marry me with OctaviusCaesar, and companion me with my mistress.SoothsayerYou shall outlive the lady whom you serve.CHARMIANO excellent! I love long life better than figs.SoothsayerYou have seen and proved a fairer former fortuneThan that which is to approach.CHARMIANThen belike my children shall have no names:prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?SoothsayerIf every of your wishes had a womb.And fertile every wish, a million.CHARMIANOut, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.ALEXASYou think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.CHARMIANNay, come, tell Iras hers.ALEXASWe'll know all our fortunes.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSMine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shallbe--drunk to bed.IRASThere's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.CHARMIANE'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.IRASGo, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.CHARMIANNay, if an oily palm be not a fruitfulprognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,tell her but a worky-day fortune.SoothsayerYour fortunes are alike.IRASBut how, but how? give me particulars.SoothsayerI have said.IRASAm I not an inch of fortune better than she?CHARMIANWell, if you were but an inch of fortune better thanI, where would you choose it?IRASNot in my husband's nose.CHARMIANOur worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a womanthat cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and lether die too, and give him a worse! and let worstfollow worse, till the worst of all follow himlaughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! GoodIsis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me amatter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!IRASAmen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome manloose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold afoul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keepdecorum, and fortune him accordingly!CHARMIANAmen.ALEXASLo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold, they would make themselves whores, butthey'ld do't!DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSHush! here comes Antony.CHARMIANNot he; the queen.Enter CLEOPATRACLEOPATRASaw you my lord?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSNo, lady.CLEOPATRAWas he not here?CHARMIANNo, madam.CLEOPATRAHe was disposed to mirth; but on the suddenA Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSMadam?CLEOPATRASeek him, and bring him hither.Where's Alexas?ALEXASHere, at your service. My lord approaches.CLEOPATRAWe will not look upon him: go with us.ExeuntEnter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and AttendantsMessengerFulvia thy wife first came into the field.MARK ANTONYAgainst my brother Lucius?MessengerAy:But soon that war had end, and the time's stateMade friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,Upon the first encounter, drave them.MARK ANTONYWell, what worst?MessengerThe nature of bad news infects the teller.MARK ANTONYWhen it concerns the fool or coward. On:Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,I hear him as he flatter'd.MessengerLabienus--This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,Extended Asia from Euphrates;His conquering banner shook from SyriaTo Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--MARK ANTONYAntony, thou wouldst say,--MessengerO, my lord!MARK ANTONYSpeak to me home, mince not the general tongue:Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faultsWith such full licence as both truth and maliceHave power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told usIs as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.MessengerAt your noble pleasure.ExitMARK ANTONYFrom Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!First AttendantThe man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?Second AttendantHe stays upon your will.MARK ANTONYLet him appear.These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,Or lose myself in dotage.Enter another MessengerWhat are you?Second MessengerFulvia thy wife is dead.MARK ANTONYWhere died she?Second MessengerIn Sicyon:Her length of sickness, with what else more seriousImporteth thee to know, this bears.Gives a letterMARK ANTONYForbear me.Exit Second MessengerThere's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:What our contempt doth often hurl from us,We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,By revolution lowering, does becomeThe opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.I must from this enchanting queen break off:Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSDOMITIUS ENOBARBUSWhat's your pleasure, sir?MARK ANTONYI must with haste from hence.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSWhy, then, we kill all our women:we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;if they suffer our departure, death's the word.MARK ANTONYI must be gone.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSUnder a compelling occasion, let women die; it werepity to cast them away for nothing; though, betweenthem and a great cause, they should be esteemednothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise ofthis, dies instantly; I have seen her die twentytimes upon far poorer moment: I do think there ismettle in death, which commits some loving act uponher, she hath such a celerity in dying.MARK ANTONYShe is cunning past man's thought.Exit ALEXASDOMITIUS ENOBARBUSAlack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing butthe finest part of pure love: we cannot call herwinds and waters sighs and tears; they are greaterstorms and tempests than almanacs can report: thiscannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes ashower of rain as well as Jove.MARK ANTONYWould I had never seen her.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSO, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful pieceof work; which not to have been blest withal wouldhave discredited your travel.MARK ANTONYFulvia is dead.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSSir?MARK ANTONYFulvia is dead.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSFulvia!MARK ANTONYDead.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSWhy, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. Whenit pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a manfrom him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;comforting therein, that when old robes are wornout, there are members to make new. If there wereno more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,and the case to be lamented: this grief is crownedwith consolation; your old smock brings forth a newpetticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onionthat should water this sorrow.MARK ANTONYThe business she hath broached in the stateCannot endure my absence.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSAnd the business you have broached here cannot bewithout you; especially that of Cleopatra's, whichwholly depends on your abode.MARK ANTONYNo more light answers. Let our officersHave notice what we purpose. I shall breakThe cause of our expedience to the queen,And get her leave to part. For not aloneThe death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,Do strongly speak to us; but the letters tooOf many our contriving friends in RomePetition us at home: Sextus PompeiusHath given the dare to Caesar, and commandsThe empire of the sea: our slippery people,Whose love is never link'd to the deserverTill his deserts are past, begin to throwPompey the Great and all his dignitiesUpon his son; who, high in name and power,Higher than both in blood and life, stands upFor the main soldier: whose quality, going on,The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,To such whose place is under us, requiresOur quick remove from hence.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSI shall do't.ExeuntSCENE III. The same. Another room.Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXASCLEOPATRAWhere is he?CHARMIANI did not see him since.CLEOPATRASee where he is, who's with him, what he does:I did not send you: if you find him sad,Say I am dancing; if in mirth, reportThat I am sudden sick: quick, and return.Exit ALEXASCHARMIANMadam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,You do not hold the method to enforceThe like from him.CLEOPATRAWhat should I do, I do not?CHARMIANIn each thing give him way, cross him nothing.CLEOPATRAThou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.CHARMIANTempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:In time we hate that which we often fear.But here comes Antony.Enter MARK ANTONYCLEOPATRAI am sick and sullen.MARK ANTONYI am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--CLEOPATRAHelp me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:It cannot be thus long, the sides of natureWill not sustain it.MARK ANTONYNow, my dearest queen,--CLEOPATRAPray you, stand further from me.MARK ANTONYWhat's the matter?CLEOPATRAI know, by that same eye, there's some good news.What says the married woman? You may go:Would she had never given you leave to come!Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:I have no power upon you; hers you are.MARK ANTONYThe gods best know,--CLEOPATRAO, never was there queenSo mightily betray'd! yet at the firstI saw the treasons planted.MARK ANTONYCleopatra,--CLEOPATRAWhy should I think you can be mine and true,Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,Which break themselves in swearing!MARK ANTONYMost sweet queen,--CLEOPATRANay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,Then was the time for words: no going then;Eternity was in our lips and eyes,Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,But was a race of heaven: they are so still,Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,Art turn'd the greatest liar.MARK ANTONYHow now, lady!CLEOPATRAI would I had thy inches; thou shouldst knowThere were a heart in Egypt.MARK ANTONYHear me, queen:The strong necessity of time commandsOur services awhile; but my full heartRemains in use with you. Our ItalyShines o'er with civil swords: Sextus PompeiusMakes his approaches to the port of Rome:Equality of two domestic powersBreed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,Into the hearts of such as have not thrivedUpon the present state, whose numbers threaten;And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purgeBy any desperate change: my more particular,And that which most with you should safe my going,Is Fulvia's death.CLEOPATRAThough age from folly could not give me freedom,It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?MARK ANTONYShe's dead, my queen:Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure readThe garboils she awaked; at the last, best:See when and where she died.CLEOPATRAO most false love!Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fillWith sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.MARK ANTONYQuarrel no more, but be prepared to knowThe purposes I bear; which are, or cease,As you shall give the advice. By the fireThat quickens Nilus' slime, I go from henceThy soldier, servant; making peace or warAs thou affect'st.CLEOPATRACut my lace, Charmian, come;But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,So Antony loves.MARK ANTONYMy precious queen, forbear;And give true evidence to his love, which standsAn honourable trial.CLEOPATRASo Fulvia told me.I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,Then bid adieu to me, and say the tearsBelong to Egypt: good now, play one sceneOf excellent dissembling; and let it lookLife perfect honour.MARK ANTONYYou'll heat my blood: no more.CLEOPATRAYou can do better yet; but this is meetly.MARK ANTONYNow, by my sword,--CLEOPATRAAnd target. Still he mends;But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,How this Herculean Roman does becomeThe carriage of his chafe.MARK ANTONYI'll leave you, lady.CLEOPATRACourteous lord, one word.Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;That you know well: something it is I would,O, my oblivion is a very Antony,And I am all forgotten.MARK ANTONYBut that your royaltyHolds idleness your subject, I should take youFor idleness itself.CLEOPATRA'Tis sweating labourTo bear such idleness so near the heartAs Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;Since my becomings kill me, when they do notEye well to you: your honour calls you hence;Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.And all the gods go with you! upon your swordSit laurel victory! and smooth successBe strew'd before your feet!MARK ANTONYLet us go. Come;Our separation so abides, and flies,That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!ExeuntSCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their TrainOCTAVIUS CAESARYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,It is not Caesar's natural vice to hateOur great competitor: from AlexandriaThis is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastesThe lamps of night in revel; is not more man-likeThan Cleopatra; nor the queen of PtolemyMore womanly than he; hardly gave audience, orVouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find thereA man who is the abstract of all faultsThat all men follow.LEPIDUSI must not think there areEvils enow to darken all his goodness:His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,Than what he chooses.OCTAVIUS CAESARYou are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is notAmiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sitAnd keep the turn of tippling with a slave;To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffetWith knaves that smell of sweat: say thisbecomes him,--As his composure must be rare indeedWhom these things cannot blemish,--yet must AntonyNo way excuse his soils, when we do bearSo great weight in his lightness. If he fill'dHis vacancy with his voluptuousness,Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,Call on him for't: but to confound such time,That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loudAs his own state and ours,--'tis to be chidAs we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,And so rebel to judgment.Enter a MessengerLEPIDUSHere's more news.MessengerThy biddings have been done; and every hour,Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have reportHow 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;And it appears he is beloved of thoseThat only have fear'd Caesar: to the portsThe discontents repair, and men's reportsGive him much wrong'd.OCTAVIUS CAESARI should have known no less.It hath been taught us from the primal state,That he which is was wish'd until he were;And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,To rot itself with motion.MessengerCaesar, I bring thee word,Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,Make the sea serve them, which they ear and woundWith keels of every kind: many hot inroadsThey make in Italy; the borders maritimeLack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soonTaken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes moreThan could his war resisted.OCTAVIUS CAESARAntony,Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou onceWast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'stHirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heelDid famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,Though daintily brought up, with patience moreThan savages could suffer: thou didst drinkThe stale of horses, and the gilded puddleWhich beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deignThe roughest berry on the rudest hedge;Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the AlpsIt is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,Which some did die to look on: and all this--It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheekSo much as lank'd not.LEPIDUS'Tis pity of him.OCTAVIUS CAESARLet his shames quicklyDrive him to Rome: 'tis time we twainDid show ourselves i' the field; and to that endAssemble we immediate council: PompeyThrives in our idleness.LEPIDUSTo-morrow, Caesar,I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightlyBoth what by sea and land I can be ableTo front this present time.OCTAVIUS CAESARTill which encounter,It is my business too. Farewell.LEPIDUSFarewell, my lord: what you shall know meantimeOf stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,To let me be partaker.OCTAVIUS CAESARDoubt not, sir;I knew it for my bond.ExeuntSCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIANCLEOPATRACharmian!CHARMIANMadam?CLEOPATRAHa, ha!Give me to drink mandragora.CHARMIANWhy, madam?CLEOPATRAThat I might sleep out this great gap of timeMy Antony is away.CHARMIANYou think of him too much.CLEOPATRAO, 'tis treason!CHARMIANMadam, I trust, not so.CLEOPATRAThou, eunuch Mardian!MARDIANWhat's your highness' pleasure?CLEOPATRANot now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasureIn aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughtsMay not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?MARDIANYes, gracious madam.CLEOPATRAIndeed!MARDIANNot in deed, madam; for I can do nothingBut what indeed is honest to be done:Yet have I fierce affections, and thinkWhat Venus did with Mars.CLEOPATRAO Charmian,Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?The demi-Atlas of this earth, the armAnd burgonet of men. He's speaking now,Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'For so he calls me: now I feed myselfWith most delicious poison. Think on me,That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,When thou wast here above the ground, I wasA morsel for a monarch: and great PompeyWould stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;There would he anchor his aspect and dieWith looking on his life.Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESARALEXASSovereign of Egypt, hail!CLEOPATRAHow much unlike art thou Mark Antony!Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hathWith his tinct gilded thee.How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?ALEXASLast thing he did, dear queen,He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.CLEOPATRAMine ear must pluck it thence.ALEXAS'Good friend,' quoth he,'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sendsThis treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,To mend the petty present, I will pieceHer opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spokeWas beastly dumb'd by him.CLEOPATRAWhat, was he sad or merry?ALEXASLike to the time o' the year between the extremesOf hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.CLEOPATRAO well-divided disposition! Note him,Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:He was not sad, for he would shine on thoseThat make their looks by his; he was not merry,Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance layIn Egypt with his joy; but between both:O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,The violence of either thee becomes,So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?ALEXASAy, madam, twenty several messengers:Why do you send so thick?CLEOPATRAWho's born that dayWhen I forget to send to Antony,Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,Ever love Caesar so?CHARMIANO that brave Caesar!CLEOPATRABe choked with such another emphasis!Say, the brave Antony.CHARMIANThe valiant Caesar!CLEOPATRABy Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,If thou with Caesar paragon againMy man of men.CHARMIANBy your most gracious pardon,I sing but after you.CLEOPATRAMy salad days,When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,To say as I said then! But, come, away;Get me ink and paper:He shall have every day a several greeting,Or I'll unpeople Egypt.ExeuntACT IISCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike mannerPOMPEYIf the great gods be just, they shall assistThe deeds of justest men.MENECRATESKnow, worthy Pompey,That what they do delay, they not deny.POMPEYWhiles we are suitors to their throne, decaysThe thing we sue for.MENECRATESWe, ignorant of ourselves,Beg often our own harms, which the wise powersDeny us for our good; so find we profitBy losing of our prayers.POMPEYI shall do well:The people love me, and the sea is mine;My powers are crescent, and my auguring hopeSays it will come to the full. Mark AntonyIn Egypt sits at dinner, and will makeNo wars without doors: Caesar gets money whereHe loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,Nor either cares for him.MENASCaesar and LepidusAre in the field: a mighty strength they carry.POMPEYWhere have you this? 'tis false.MENASFrom Silvius, sir.POMPEYHe dreams: I know they are in Rome together,Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooksSharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honourEven till a Lethe'd dulness!Enter VARRIUSHow now, Varrius!VARRIUSThis is most certain that I shall deliver:Mark Antony is every hour in RomeExpected: since he went from Egypt 'tisA space for further travel.POMPEYI could have given less matterA better ear. Menas, I did not thinkThis amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helmFor such a petty war: his soldiershipIs twice the other twain: but let us rearThe higher our opinion, that our stirringCan from the lap of Egypt's widow pluckThe ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.MENASI cannot hopeCaesar and Antony shall well greet together:His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,Not moved by Antony.POMPEYI know not, Menas,How lesser enmities may give way to greater.Were't not that we stand up against them all,'Twere pregnant they should square betweenthemselves;For they have entertained cause enoughTo draw their swords: but how the fear of usMay cement their divisions and bind upThe petty difference, we yet not know.Be't as our gods will have't! It only standsOur lives upon to use our strongest hands.Come, Menas.ExeuntSCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUSLEPIDUSGood Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,And shall become you well, to entreat your captainTo soft and gentle speech.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSI shall entreat himTo answer like himself: if Caesar move him,Let Antony look over Caesar's headAnd speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,I would not shave't to-day.LEPIDUS'Tis not a timeFor private stomaching.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSEvery timeServes for the matter that is then born in't.LEPIDUSBut small to greater matters must give way.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSNot if the small come first.LEPIDUSYour speech is passion:But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comesThe noble Antony.Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUSDOMITIUS ENOBARBUSAnd yonder, Caesar.Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPAMARK ANTONYIf we compose well here, to Parthia:Hark, Ventidius.OCTAVIUS CAESARI do not know,Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.LEPIDUSNoble friends,That which combined us was most great, and let notA leaner action rend us. What's amiss,May it be gently heard: when we debateOur trivial difference loud, we do commitMurder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,The rather, for I earnestly beseech,Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,Nor curstness grow to the matter.MARK ANTONY'Tis spoken well.Were we before our armies, and to fight.I should do thus.FlourishOCTAVIUS CAESARWelcome to Rome.MARK ANTONYThank you.OCTAVIUS CAESARSit.MARK ANTONYSit, sir.OCTAVIUS CAESARNay, then.MARK ANTONYI learn, you take things ill which are not so,Or being, concern you not.OCTAVIUS CAESARI must be laugh'd at,If, or for nothing or a little, IShould say myself offended, and with youChiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I shouldOnce name you derogately, when to sound your nameIt not concern'd me.MARK ANTONYMy being in Egypt, Caesar,What was't to you?OCTAVIUS CAESARNo more than my residing here at RomeMight be to you in Egypt: yet, if you thereDid practise on my state, your being in EgyptMight be my question.MARK ANTONYHow intend you, practised?OCTAVIUS CAESARYou may be pleased to catch at mine intentBy what did here befal me. Your wife and brotherMade wars upon me; and their contestationWas theme for you, you were the word of war.MARK ANTONYYou do mistake your business; my brother neverDid urge me in his act: I did inquire it;And have my learning from some true reports,That drew their swords with you. Did he not ratherDiscredit my authority with yours;And make the wars alike against my stomach,Having alike your cause? Of this my lettersBefore did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,As matter whole you have not to make it with,It must not be with this.OCTAVIUS CAESARYou praise yourselfBy laying defects of judgment to me; butYou patch'd up your excuses.MARK ANTONYNot so, not so;I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,Very necessity of this thought, that I,Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,Could not with graceful eyes attend those warsWhich fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,I would you had her spirit in such another:The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffleYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSWould we had all such wives, that the men might goto wars with the women!MARK ANTONYSo much uncurbable, her garboils, CaesarMade out of her impatience, which not wantedShrewdness of policy too, I grieving grantDid you too much disquiet: for that you mustBut say, I could not help it.OCTAVIUS CAESARI wrote to youWhen rioting in Alexandria; youDid pocket up my letters, and with tauntsDid gibe my missive out of audience.MARK ANTONYSir,He fell upon me ere admitted: thenThree kings I had newly feasted, and did wantOf what I was i' the morning: but next dayI told him of myself; which was as muchAs to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellowBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,Out of our question wipe him.OCTAVIUS CAESARYou have brokenThe article of your oath; which you shall neverHave tongue to charge me with.LEPIDUSSoft, Caesar!MARK ANTONYNo,Lepidus, let him speak:The honour is sacred which he talks on now,Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;The article of my oath.OCTAVIUS CAESARTo lend me arms and aid when I required them;The which you both denied.MARK ANTONYNeglected, rather;And then when poison'd hours had bound me upFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honestyShall not make poor my greatness, nor my powerWork without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;For which myself, the ignorant motive, doSo far ask pardon as befits mine honourTo stoop in such a case.LEPIDUS'Tis noble spoken.MECAENASIf it might please you, to enforce no furtherThe griefs between ye: to forget them quiteWere to remember that the present needSpeaks to atone you.LEPIDUSWorthily spoken, Mecaenas.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSOr, if you borrow one another's love for theinstant, you may, when you hear no more words ofPompey, return it again: you shall have time towrangle in when you have nothing else to do.MARK ANTONYThou art a soldier only: speak no more.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSThat truth should be silent I had almost forgot.MARK ANTONYYou wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSGo to, then; your considerate stone.OCTAVIUS CAESARI do not much dislike the matter, butThe manner of his speech; for't cannot beWe shall remain in friendship, our conditionsSo differing in their acts. Yet if I knewWhat hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edgeO' the world I would pursue it.AGRIPPAGive me leave, Caesar,--OCTAVIUS CAESARSpeak, Agrippa.AGRIPPAThou hast a sister by the mother's side,Admired Octavia: great Mark AntonyIs now a widower.OCTAVIUS CAESARSay not so, Agrippa:If Cleopatra heard you, your reproofWere well deserved of rashness.MARK ANTONYI am not married, Caesar: let me hearAgrippa further speak.AGRIPPATo hold you in perpetual amity,To make you brothers, and to knit your heartsWith an unslipping  knot, take AntonyOctavia to his wife; whose beauty claimsNo worse a husband than the best of men;Whose virtue and whose general graces speakThat which none else can utter. By this marriage,All little jealousies, which now seem great,And all great fears, which now import their dangers,Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,Where now half tales be truths: her love to bothWould, each to other and all loves to both,Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,By duty ruminated.MARK ANTONYWill Caesar speak?OCTAVIUS CAESARNot till he hears how Antony is touch'dWith what is spoke already.MARK ANTONYWhat power is in Agrippa,If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'To make this good?OCTAVIUS CAESARThe power of Caesar, andHis power unto Octavia.MARK ANTONYMay I neverTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:Further this act of grace: and from this hourThe heart of brothers govern in our lovesAnd sway our great designs!OCTAVIUS CAESARThere is my hand.A sister I bequeath you, whom no brotherDid ever love so dearly: let her liveTo join our kingdoms and our hearts; and neverFly off our loves again!LEPIDUSHappily, amen!MARK ANTONYI did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;For he hath laid strange courtesies and greatOf late upon me: I must thank him only,Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;At heel of that, defy him.LEPIDUSTime calls upon's:Of us must Pompey presently be sought,Or else he seeks out us.MARK ANTONYWhere lies he?OCTAVIUS CAESARAbout the mount Misenum.MARK ANTONYWhat is his strength by land?OCTAVIUS CAESARGreat and increasing: but by seaHe is an absolute master.MARK ANTONYSo is the fame.Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch weThe business we have talk'd of.OCTAVIUS CAESARWith most gladness:And do invite you to my sister's view,Whither straight I'll lead you.MARK ANTONYLet us, Lepidus,Not lack your company.LEPIDUSNoble Antony,Not sickness should detain me.Flourish.

Myhonourable friend, Agrippa!AGRIPPAGood Enobarbus!MECAENASWe have cause to be glad that matters are so welldigested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSAy, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, andmade the night light with drinking.MECAENASEight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, andbut twelve persons there; is this true?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSThis was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much moremonstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.MECAENASShe's a most triumphant lady, if report be square toher.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSWhen she first met Mark Antony, she pursed uphis heart, upon the river of Cydnus.AGRIPPAThere she appeared indeed; or my reporter devisedwell for her.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSI will tell you.The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;Purple the sails, and so perfumed thatThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and madeThe water which they beat to follow faster,As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,It beggar'd all description: she did lieIn her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--O'er-picturing that Venus where we seeThe fancy outwork nature: on each side herStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seemTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,And what they undid did.AGRIPPAO, rare for Antony!DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSHer gentlewomen, like the Nereides,So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,And made their bends adornings: at the helmA seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackleSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,That yarely frame the office. From the bargeA strange invisible perfume hits the senseOf the adjacent wharfs. The city castHer people out upon her; and Antony,Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,And made a gap in nature.AGRIPPARare Egyptian!DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSUpon her landing, Antony sent to her,Invited her to supper: she replied,It should be better he became her guest;Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,And for his ordinary pays his heartFor what his eyes eat only.AGRIPPARoyal wench!She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSI saw her onceHop forty paces through the public street;And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,That she did make defect perfection,And, breathless, power breathe forth.MECAENASNow Antony must leave her utterly.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSNever; he will not:Age cannot wither her, nor custom staleHer infinite variety: other women cloyThe appetites they feed: but she makes hungryWhere most she satisfies; for vilest thingsBecome themselves in her: that the holy priestsBless her when she is riggish.MECAENASIf beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settleThe heart of Antony, Octavia isA blessed lottery to him.AGRIPPALet us go.Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guestWhilst you abide here.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSHumbly, sir, I thank you.ExeuntSCENE III.

Be it art or hap,He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;And in our sports my better cunning faintsUnder his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;His cocks do win the battle still of mine,When it is all to nought; and his quails everBeat mine, inhoop'd, at odds.

Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,  with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,  MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marchingPOMPEYYour hostages I have, so have you mine;And we shall talk before we fight.OCTAVIUS CAESARMost meetThat first we come to words; and therefore have weOur written purposes before us sent;Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us knowIf 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,And carry back to Sicily much tall youthThat else must perish here.POMPEYTo you all three,The senators alone of this great world,Chief factors for the gods, I do not knowWherefore my father should revengers want,Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,There saw you labouring for him. What was'tThat moved pale Cassius to conspire; and whatMade the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,To drench the Capitol; but that they wouldHave one man but a man? And that is itHath made me rig my navy; at whose burthenThe anger'd ocean foams; with which I meantTo scourge the ingratitude that despiteful RomeCast on my noble father.OCTAVIUS CAESARTake your time.MARK ANTONYThou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'stHow much we do o'er-count thee.POMPEYAt land, indeed,Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,Remain in't as thou mayst.LEPIDUSBe pleased to tell us--For this is from the present--how you takeThe offers we have sent you.OCTAVIUS CAESARThere's the point.MARK ANTONYWhich do not be entreated to, but weighWhat it is worth embraced.OCTAVIUS CAESARAnd what may follow,To try a larger fortune.POMPEYYou have made me offerOf Sicily, Sardinia; and I mustRid all the sea of pirates; then, to sendMeasures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed uponTo part with unhack'd edges, and bear backOur targes undinted.OCTAVIUS CAESARMARK ANTONYLEPIDUSThat's our offer.POMPEYKnow, then,I came before you here a man preparedTo take this offer: but Mark AntonyPut me to some impatience: though I loseThe praise of it by telling, you must know,When Caesar and your brother were at blows,Your mother came to Sicily and did findHer welcome friendly.MARK ANTONYI have heard it, Pompey;And am well studied for a liberal thanksWhich I do owe you.POMPEYLet me have your hand:I did not think, sir, to have met you here.MARK ANTONYThe beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;For I have gain'd by 't.OCTAVIUS CAESARSince I saw you last,There is a change upon you.POMPEYWell, I know notWhat counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;But in my bosom shall she never come,To make my heart her vassal.LEPIDUSWell met here.POMPEYI hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:I crave our composition may be written,And seal'd between us.OCTAVIUS CAESARThat's the next to do.POMPEYWe'll feast each other ere we part; and let'sDraw lots who shall begin.MARK ANTONYThat will I, Pompey.POMPEYNo, Antony, take the lot: but, firstOr last, your fine Egyptian cookeryShall have the fame. I have heard that Julius CaesarGrew fat with feasting there.MARK ANTONYYou have heard much.POMPEYI have fair meanings, sir.MARK ANTONYAnd fair words to them.POMPEYThen so much have I heard:And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSNo more of that: he did so.POMPEYWhat, I pray you?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSA certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.POMPEYI know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSWell;And well am like to do; for, I perceive,Four feasts are toward.POMPEYLet me shake thy hand;I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,When I have envied thy behavior.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSSir,I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,When you have well deserved ten times as muchAs I have said you did.POMPEYEnjoy thy plainness,It nothing ill becomes thee.Aboard my galley I invite you all:Will you lead, lords?OCTAVIUS CAESARMARK ANTONYLEPIDUSShow us the way, sir.POMPEYCome.Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUSMENAS[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er havemade this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSAt sea, I think.MENASWe have, sir.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSYou have done well by water.MENASAnd you by land.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSI will praise any man that will praise me; though itcannot be denied what I have done by land.MENASNor what I have done by water.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSYes, something you can deny for your ownsafety: you have been a great thief by sea.MENASAnd you by land.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSThere I deny my land service. But give me yourhand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here theymight take two thieves kissing.MENASAll men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSBut there is never a fair woman has a true face.MENASNo slander; they steal hearts.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSWe came hither to fight with you.MENASFor my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSIf he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.MENASYou've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antonyhere: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSCaesar's sister is called Octavia.MENASTrue, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSBut she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.MENASPray ye, sir?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS'Tis true.MENASThen is Caesar and he for ever knit together.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSIf I were bound to divine of this unity, I wouldnot prophesy so.MENASI think the policy of that purpose made more in themarriage than the love of the parties.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSI think so too. But you shall find, the band thatseems to tie their friendship together will be thevery strangler of their amity: Octavia is of aholy, cold, and still conversation.MENASWho would not have his wife so?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSNot he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall thesighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, asI said before, that which is the strength of theiramity shall prove the immediate author of theirvariance. Antony will use his affection where it is:he married but his occasion here.MENASAnd thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?I have a health for you.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSI shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.MENASCome, let's away.ExeuntSCENE VII.

And the tears of it are wet.OCTAVIUS CAESARWill this description satisfy him?MARK ANTONYWith the health that Pompey gives him, else he is avery epicure.POMPEY[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me ofthat? away!Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?MENAS[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thouwilt hear me,Rise from thy stool.POMPEY[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.The matter?Rises, and walks asideMENASI have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.POMPEYThou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?Be jolly, lords.MARK ANTONYThese quick-sands, Lepidus,Keep off them, for you sink.MENASWilt thou be lord of all the world?POMPEYWhat say'st thou?MENASWilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.POMPEYHow should that be?MENASBut entertain it,And, though thou think me poor, I am the manWill give thee all the world.POMPEYHast thou drunk well?MENASNow, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.POMPEYShow me which way.MENASThese three world-sharers, these competitors,Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:All there is thine.POMPEYAh, this thou shouldst have done,And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongueHath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,I should have found it afterwards well done;But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.MENAS[Aside]  For this,I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,Shall never find it more.POMPEYThis health to Lepidus!MARK ANTONYBear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSHere's to thee, Menas!MENASEnobarbus, welcome!POMPEYFill till the cup be hid.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSThere's a strong fellow, Menas.Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUSMENASWhy?DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSA' bears the third part of the world, man; see'stnot?MENASThe third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,That it might go on wheels!DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSDrink thou; increase the reels.MENASCome.POMPEYThis is not yet an Alexandrian feast.MARK ANTONYIt ripens towards it.

Bear the king's son's bodyBefore our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,Pays this for Marcus Crassus.SILIUSNoble Ventidius,Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,Mesopotamia, and the shelters whitherThe routed fly: so thy grand captain AntonyShall set thee on triumphant chariots andPut garlands on thy head.VENTIDIUSO Silius, Silius,I have done enough; a lower place, note well,May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;Better to leave undone, than by our deedAcquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.Caesar and Antony have ever wonMore in their officer than person: Sossius,One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,For quick accumulation of renown,Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.Who does i' the wars more than his captain canBecomes his captain's captain: and ambition,The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,Than gain which darkens him.I could do more to do Antonius good,But 'twould offend him; and in his offenceShould my performance perish.SILIUSThou hast, Ventidius,thatWithout the which a soldier, and his sword,Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!VENTIDIUSI'll humbly signify what in his name,That magical word of war, we have effected;How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of ParthiaWe have jaded out o' the field.SILIUSWhere is he now?VENTIDIUSHe purposeth to Athens: whither, with what hasteThe weight we must convey with's will permit,We shall appear before him.

If Caesar please, our masterWill leap to be his friend: for us, you know,Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.THYREUSSo.Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,Further than he is Caesar.CLEOPATRAGo on: right royal.THYREUSHe knows that you embrace not AntonyAs you did love, but as you fear'd him.CLEOPATRAO!THYREUSThe scars upon your honour, therefore, heDoes pity, as constrained blemishes,Not as deserved.CLEOPATRAHe is a god, and knowsWhat is most right: mine honour was not yielded,But conquer'd merely.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS[Aside]             To be sure of that,I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,That we must leave thee to thy sinking, forThy dearest quit thee.ExitTHYREUSShall I say to CaesarWhat you require of him? for he partly begsTo be desired to give. It much would please him,That of his fortunes you should make a staffTo lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,To hear from me you had left Antony,And put yourself under his shrowd,The universal landlord.CLEOPATRAWhat's your name?THYREUSMy name is Thyreus.CLEOPATRAMost kind messenger,Say to great Caesar this: in deputationI kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am promptTo lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hearThe doom of Egypt.THYREUS'Tis your noblest course.Wisdom and fortune combating together,If that the former dare but what it can,No chance may shake it.

I amAntony yet.Enter AttendantsTake hence this Jack, and whip him.DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelpThan with an old one dying.MARK ANTONYMoon and stars!Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributariesThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find themSo saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.THYREUSMark Antony!MARK ANTONYTug him away: being whipp'd,Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shallBear us an errand to him.Exeunt Attendants with THYREUSYou were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,Forborne the getting of a lawful race,And by a gem of women, to be abusedBy one that looks on feeders?CLEOPATRAGood my lord,--MARK ANTONYYou have been a boggler ever:But when we in our viciousness grow hard--O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make usAdore our errors; laugh at's, while we strutTo our confusion.CLEOPATRAO, is't come to this?MARK ANTONYI found you as a morsel cold uponDead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragmentOf Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you haveLuxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,Though you can guess what temperance should be,You know not what it is.CLEOPATRAWherefore is this?MARK ANTONYTo let a fellow that will take rewardsAnd say 'God quit you!' be familiar withMy playfellow, your hand; this kingly sealAnd plighter of high hearts! O, that I wereUpon the hill of Basan, to outroarThe horned herd! for I have savage cause;And to proclaim it civilly, were likeA halter'd neck which does the hangman thankFor being yare about him.Re-enter Attendants with THYREUSIs he whipp'd?First AttendantSoundly, my lord.MARK ANTONYCried he? and begg'd a' pardon?First AttendantHe did ask favour.MARK ANTONYIf that thy father live, let him repentThou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorryTo follow Caesar in his triumph, sinceThou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforthThe white hand of a lady fever thee,Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou sayHe makes me angry with him; for he seemsProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,When my good stars, that were my former guides,Have empty left their orbs, and shot their firesInto the abysm of hell. If he mislikeMy speech and what is done, tell him he hasHipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whomHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:Hence with thy stripes, begone!Exit THYREUSCLEOPATRAHave you done yet?MARK ANTONYAlack, our terrene moonIs now eclipsed; and it portends aloneThe fall of Antony!CLEOPATRAI must stay his time.MARK ANTONYTo flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyesWith one that ties his points?CLEOPATRANot know me yet?MARK ANTONYCold-hearted toward me?CLEOPATRAAh, dear, if I be so,From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,And poison it in the source; and the first stoneDrop in my neck: as it determines, soDissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!Till by degrees the memory of my womb,Together with my brave Egyptians all,By the discandying of this pelleted storm,Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of NileHave buried them for prey!MARK ANTONYI am satisfied.Caesar sits down in Alexandria; whereI will oppose his fate. Our force by landHath nobly held; our sever'd navy tooHave knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?If from the field I shall return once moreTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;I and my sword will earn our chronicle:There's hope in't yet.CLEOPATRAThat's my brave lord!MARK ANTONYI will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,And fight maliciously: for when mine hoursWere nice and lucky, men did ransom livesOf me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,Let's have one other gaudy night: call to meAll my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;Let's mock the midnight bell.CLEOPATRAIt is my birth-day:I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lordIs Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.MARK ANTONYWe will yet do well.CLEOPATRACall all his noble captains to my lord.MARK ANTONYDo so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll forceThe wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,I'll make death love me; for I will contendEven with his pestilent scythe.Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUSDOMITIUS ENOBARBUSNow he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that moodThe dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,A diminution in our captain's brainRestores his heart: when valour preys on reason,It eats the sword it fights with. I will seekSome way to leave him.ExitACT IVSCENE I. Before Alexandria.

She had a prophesying fearOf what hath come to pass: for when she saw--Which never shall be found--you did suspectShe had disposed with Caesar, and that your rageWould not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;But, fearing since how it might work, hath sentMe to proclaim the truth; and I am come,I dread, too late.MARK ANTONYToo late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.DIOMEDESWhat, ho, the emperor's guard!

Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.MARK ANTONYPeace!Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.CLEOPATRASo it should be, that none but AntonyShould conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!MARK ANTONYI am dying, Egypt, dying; onlyI here importune death awhile, untilOf many thousand kisses the poor lastI lay up thy lips.CLEOPATRAI dare not, dear,--Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,Lest I be taken: not the imperious showOf the full-fortuned Caesar ever shallBe brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,serpents, haveEdge, sting, or operation, I am safe:Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyesAnd still conclusion, shall acquire no honourDemuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:Assist, good friends.MARK ANTONYO, quick, or I am gone.CLEOPATRAHere's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!Our strength is all gone into heaviness,That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRAAnd welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,Thus would I wear them out.AllA heavy sight!MARK ANTONYI am dying, Egypt, dying:Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.CLEOPATRANo, let me speak; and let me rail so high,That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,Provoked by my offence.MARK ANTONYOne word, sweet queen:Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!CLEOPATRAThey do not go together.MARK ANTONYGentle, hear me:None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.CLEOPATRAMy resolution and my hands I'll trust;None about Caesar.MARK ANTONYThe miserable change now at my endLament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughtsIn feeding them with those my former fortunesWherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,The noblest; and do now not basely die,Not cowardly put off my helmet toMy countryman,--a Roman by a RomanValiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;I can no more.CLEOPATRANoblest of men, woo't die?Hast thou no care of me? shall I abideIn this dull world, which in thy absence isNo better than a sty? O, see, my women,MARK ANTONY diesThe crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!O, wither'd is the garland of the war,The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girlsAre level now with men; the odds is gone,And there is nothing left remarkableBeneath the visiting moon.FaintsCHARMIANO, quietness, lady!IRASShe is dead too, our sovereign.CHARMIANLady!IRASMadam!CHARMIANO madam, madam, madam!IRASRoyal Egypt, Empress!CHARMIANPeace, peace, Iras!CLEOPATRANo more, but e'en a woman, and commandedBy such poor passion as the maid that milksAnd does the meanest chares. It were for meTo throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;To tell them that this world did equal theirsTill they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;Patience is scottish, and impatience doesBecome a dog that's mad: then is it sinTo rush into the secret house of death,Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,what's noble,Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,And make death proud to take us. Come, away:This case of that huge spirit now is cold:Ah, women, women! come; we have no friendBut resolution, and the briefest end.Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's bodyACT VSCENE I.

If thou pleaseTo take me to thee, as I was to himI'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,I yield thee up my life.OCTAVIUS CAESARWhat is't thou say'st?DERCETASI say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.OCTAVIUS CAESARThe breaking of so great a thing should makeA greater crack: the round worldShould have shook lions into civil streets,And citizens to their dens: the death of AntonyIs not a single doom; in the name layA moiety of the world.DERCETASHe is dead, Caesar:Not by a public minister of justice,Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,Which writ his honour in the acts it did,Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,Splitted the heart. This is his sword;I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'dWith his most noble blood.OCTAVIUS CAESARLook you sad, friends?The gods rebuke me, but it is tidingsTo wash the eyes of kings.AGRIPPAAnd strange it is,That nature must compel us to lamentOur most persisted deeds.MECAENASHis taints and honoursWaged equal with him.AGRIPPAA rarer spirit neverDid steer humanity: but you, gods, will give usSome faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.MECAENASWhen such a spacious mirror's set before him,He needs must see himself.OCTAVIUS CAESARO Antony!I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lanceDiseases in our bodies: I must perforceHave shown to thee such a declining day,Or look on thine; we could not stall togetherIn the whole world: but yet let me lament,With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,That thou, my brother, my competitorIn top of all design, my mate in empire,Friend and companion in the front of war,The arm of mine own body, and the heartWhere mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,Unreconciliable, should divideOur equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--But I will tell you at some meeter season:Enter an EgyptianThe business of this man looks out of him;We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?EgyptianA poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,Confined in all she has, her monument,Of thy intents desires instruction,That she preparedly may frame herselfTo the way she's forced to.OCTAVIUS CAESARBid her have good heart:She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,How honourable and how kindly weDetermine for her; for Caesar cannot liveTo be ungentle.EgyptianSo the gods preserve thee!ExitOCTAVIUS CAESARCome hither, Proculeius. Go and say,We purpose her no shame: give her what comfortsThe quality of her passion shall require,Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal strokeShe do defeat us; for her life in RomeWould be eternal in our triumph: go,And with your speediest bring us what she says,And how you find of her.PROCULEIUSCaesar, I shall.ExitOCTAVIUS CAESARGallus, go you along.Exit GALLUSWhere's Dolabella,To second Proculeius?AllDolabella!OCTAVIUS CAESARLet him alone, for I remember nowHow he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.Go with me to my tent; where you shall seeHow hardly I was drawn into this war;How calm and gentle I proceeded stillIn all my writings: go with me, and seeWhat I can show in this.ExeuntSCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRASCLEOPATRAMy desolation does begin to makeA better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,A minister of her will: and it is greatTo do that thing that ends all other deeds;Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and SoldiersPROCULEIUSCaesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;And bids thee study on what fair demandsThou mean'st to have him grant thee.CLEOPATRAWhat's thy name?PROCULEIUSMy name is Proculeius.CLEOPATRAAntonyDid tell me of you, bade me trust you; butI do not greatly care to be deceived,That have no use for trusting. If your masterWould have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,That majesty, to keep decorum, mustNo less beg than a kingdom: if he pleaseTo give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,He gives me so much of mine own, as IWill kneel to him with thanks.PROCULEIUSBe of good cheer;You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:Make your full reference freely to my lord,Who is so full of grace, that it flows overOn all that need: let me report to himYour sweet dependency; and you shall findA conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,Where he for grace is kneel'd to.CLEOPATRAPray you, tell himI am his fortune's vassal, and I send himThe greatness he has got. I hourly learnA doctrine of obedience; and would gladlyLook him i' the face.PROCULEIUSThis I'll report, dear lady.Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitiedOf him that caused it.GALLUSYou see how easily she may be surprised:Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,  having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gatesTo PROCULEIUS and the GuardGuard her till Caesar come.ExitIRASRoyal queen!CHARMIANO Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:CLEOPATRAQuick, quick, good hands.Drawing a daggerPROCULEIUSHold, worthy lady, hold:Seizes and disarms herDo not yourself such wrong, who are in thisRelieved, but not betray'd.CLEOPATRAWhat, of death too,That rids our dogs of languish?PROCULEIUSCleopatra,Do not abuse my master's bounty byThe undoing of yourself: let the world seeHis nobleness well acted, which your deathWill never let come forth.CLEOPATRAWhere art thou, death?Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queenWorthy many babes and beggars!PROCULEIUSO, temperance, lady!CLEOPATRASir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;If idle talk will once be necessary,I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that IWill not wait pinion'd at your master's court;Nor once be chastised with the sober eyeOf dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me upAnd show me to the shouting varletryOf censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in EgyptBe gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mudLay me stark naked, and let the water-fliesBlow me into abhorring! rather makeMy country's high pyramides my gibbet,And hang me up in chains!PROCULEIUSYou do extendThese thoughts of horror further than you shallFind cause in Caesar.Enter DOLABELLADOLABELLAProculeius,What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,I'll take her to my guard.PROCULEIUSSo, Dolabella,It shall content me best: be gentle to her.To CLEOPATRATo Caesar I will speak what you shall please,If you'll employ me to him.CLEOPATRASay, I would die.Exeunt PROCULEIUS and SoldiersDOLABELLAMost noble empress, you have heard of me?CLEOPATRAI cannot tell.DOLABELLAAssuredly you know me.CLEOPATRANo matter, sir, what I have heard or known.You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;Is't not your trick?DOLABELLAI understand not, madam.CLEOPATRAI dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:O, such another sleep, that I might seeBut such another man!DOLABELLAIf it might please ye,--CLEOPATRAHis face was as the heavens; and therein stuckA sun and moon, which kept their course,and lightedThe little O, the earth.DOLABELLAMost sovereign creature,--CLEOPATRAHis legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd armCrested the world: his voice was propertiedAs all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twasThat grew the more by reaping: his delightsWere dolphin-like; they show'd his back aboveThe element they lived in: in his liveryWalk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands wereAs plates dropp'd from his pocket.DOLABELLACleopatra!CLEOPATRAThink you there was, or might be, such a manAs this I dream'd of?DOLABELLAGentle madam, no.CLEOPATRAYou lie, up to the hearing of the gods.But, if there be, or ever were, one such,It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuffTo vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagineAnd Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,Condemning shadows quite.DOLABELLAHear me, good madam.Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear itAs answering to the weight: would I might neverO'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,By the rebound of yours, a grief that smitesMy very heart at root.CLEOPATRAI thank you, sir,Know you what Caesar means to do with me?DOLABELLAI am loath to tell you what I would you knew.CLEOPATRANay, pray you, sir,--DOLABELLAThough he be honourable,--CLEOPATRAHe'll lead me, then, in triumph?DOLABELLAMadam, he will; I know't.Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his TrainOCTAVIUS CAESARWhich is the Queen of Egypt?DOLABELLAIt is the emperor, madam.CLEOPATRA kneelsOCTAVIUS CAESARArise, you shall not kneel:I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.CLEOPATRASir, the godsWill have it thus; my master and my lordI must obey.OCTAVIUS CAESARTake to you no hard thoughts:The record of what injuries you did us,Though written in our flesh, we shall rememberAs things but done by chance.CLEOPATRASole sir o' the world,I cannot project mine own cause so wellTo make it clear; but do confess I haveBeen laden with like frailties which beforeHave often shamed our sex.OCTAVIUS CAESARCleopatra, know,We will extenuate rather than enforce:If you apply yourself to our intents,Which towards you are most gentle, you shall findA benefit in this change; but if you seekTo lay on me a cruelty, by takingAntony's course, you shall bereave yourselfOf my good purposes, and put your childrenTo that destruction which I'll guard them from,If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.CLEOPATRAAnd may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shallHang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.OCTAVIUS CAESARYou shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.CLEOPATRAThis is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?SELEUCUSHere, madam.CLEOPATRAThis is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,Upon his peril, that I have reservedTo myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.SELEUCUSMadam,I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,Speak that which is not.CLEOPATRAWhat have I kept back?SELEUCUSEnough to purchase what you have made known.OCTAVIUS CAESARNay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approveYour wisdom in the deed.CLEOPATRASee, Caesar! O, behold,How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.The ingratitude of this Seleucus doesEven make me wild: O slave, of no more trustThan love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shaltGo back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!O rarely base!OCTAVIUS CAESARGood queen, let us entreat you.CLEOPATRAO Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,Doing the honour of thy lordlinessTo one so meek, that mine own servant shouldParcel the sum of my disgraces byAddition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,That I some lady trifles have reserved,Immoment toys, things of such dignityAs we greet modern friends withal; and say,Some nobler token I have kept apartFor Livia and Octavia, to induceTheir mediation; must I be unfoldedWith one that I have bred? The gods! it smites meBeneath the fall I have.To SELEUCUSPrithee, go hence;Or I shall show the cinders of my spiritsThrough the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,Thou wouldst have mercy on me.OCTAVIUS CAESARForbear, Seleucus.Exit SELEUCUSCLEOPATRABe it known, that we, the greatest, are misthoughtFor things that others do; and, when we fall,We answer others' merits in our name,Are therefore to be pitied.OCTAVIUS CAESARCleopatra,Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with youOf things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;For we intend so to dispose you asYourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:Our care and pity is so much upon you,That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.CLEOPATRAMy master, and my lord!OCTAVIUS CAESARNot so. Adieu.Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his trainCLEOPATRAHe words me, girls, he words me, that I should notBe noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.Whispers CHARMIANIRASFinish, good lady; the bright day is done,And we are for the dark.CLEOPATRAHie thee again:I have spoke already, and it is provided;Go put it to the haste.CHARMIANMadam, I will.Re-enter DOLABELLADOLABELLAWhere is the queen?CHARMIANBehold, sir.ExitCLEOPATRADolabella!DOLABELLAMadam, as thereto sworn by your command,Which my love makes religion to obey,I tell you this: Caesar through SyriaIntends his journey; and within three daysYou with your children will he send before:Make your best use of this: I have perform'dYour pleasure and my promise.CLEOPATRADolabella,I shall remain your debtor.DOLABELLAI your servant,Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.CLEOPATRAFarewell, and thanks.Exit DOLABELLANow, Iras, what think'st thou?Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shownIn Rome, as well as I	mechanic slavesWith greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shallUplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,And forced to drink their vapour.IRASThe gods forbid!CLEOPATRANay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictorsWill catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymersBallad us out o' tune: the quick comediansExtemporally will stage us, and presentOur Alexandrian revels; AntonyShall be brought drunken forth, and I shall seeSome squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatnessI' the posture of a whore.IRASO the good gods!CLEOPATRANay, that's certain.IRASI'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nailsAre stronger than mine eyes.CLEOPATRAWhy, that's the wayTo fool their preparation, and to conquerTheir most absurd intents.Re-enter CHARMIANNow, Charmian!Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetchMy best attires: I am again for Cydnus,To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leaveTo play till doomsday.

I heard of one ofthem no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,but something given to lie; as a woman should notdo, but in the way of honesty: how she died of thebiting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makesa very good report o' the worm; but he that willbelieve all that they say, shall never be saved byhalf that they do: but this is most fallible, theworm's an odd worm.CLEOPATRAGet thee hence; farewell.ClownI wish you all joy of the worm.Setting down his basketCLEOPATRAFarewell.ClownYou must think this, look you, that the worm willdo his kind.CLEOPATRAAy, ay; farewell.ClownLook you, the worm is not to be trusted but in thekeeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is nogoodness in worm.CLEOPATRATake thou no care; it shall be heeded.ClownVery good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it isnot worth the feeding.CLEOPATRAWill it eat me?ClownYou must not think I am so simple but I know thedevil himself will not eat a woman: I know that awoman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress hernot. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do thegods great harm in their women; for in every tenthat they make, the devils mar five.CLEOPATRAWell, get thee gone; farewell.ClownYes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.ExitRe-enter IRAS with a robe, crown,  & cCLEOPATRAGive me my robe, put on my crown; I haveImmortal longings in me: now no moreThe juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hearAntony call; I see him rouse himselfTo praise my noble act; I hear him mockThe luck of Caesar, which the gods give menTo excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:Now to that name my courage prove my title!I am fire and air; my other elementsI give to baser life. So; have you done?Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.Kisses them. IRAS falls and diesHave I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?If thou and nature can so gently part,The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the worldIt is not worth leave-taking.CHARMIANDissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,The gods themselves do weep!CLEOPATRAThis proves me base:If she first meet the curled Antony,He'll make demand of her, and spend that kissWhich is my heaven to have. Come, thoumortal wretch,To an asp, which she applies to her breastWith thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicateOf life at once untie: poor venomous foolBe angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,That I might hear thee call great Caesar assUnpolicied!CHARMIANO eastern star!CLEOPATRAPeace, peace!Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,That sucks the nurse asleep?CHARMIANO, break!

So, fare thee well.Now boast thee, death, in thy possession liesA lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;And golden Phoebus never be beheldOf eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;I'll mend it, and then play.Enter the Guard, rushing inFirst GuardWhere is the queen?CHARMIANSpeak softly, wake her not.First GuardCaesar hath sent--CHARMIANToo slow a messenger.Applies an aspO, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.First GuardApproach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.Second GuardThere's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.First GuardWhat work is here!

Take up her bed;And bear her women from the monument:She shall be buried by her Antony:No grave upon the earth shall clip in itA pair so famous. High events as theseStrike those that make them; and their story isNo less in pity than his glory whichBrought them to be lamented. Our army shallIn solemn show attend this funeral;And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, seeHigh order in this great solemnity.Exeunt
