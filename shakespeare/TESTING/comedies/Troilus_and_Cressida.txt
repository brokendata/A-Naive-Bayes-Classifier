ACT IPROLOGUEIn Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of GreeceThe princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,Fraught with the ministers and instrumentsOf cruel war: sixty and nine, that woreTheir crownets regal, from the Athenian bayPut forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is madeTo ransack Troy, within whose strong immuresThe ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.To Tenedos they come;And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorgeTheir warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plainsThe fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitchTheir brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,And Antenorides, with massy staplesAnd corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,Sperr up the sons of Troy.Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,Sets all on hazard: and hither am I comeA prologue arm'd, but not in confidenceOf author's pen or actor's voice, but suitedIn like conditions as our argument,To tell you, fair beholders, that our playLeaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,Beginning in the middle, starting thence awayTo what may be digested in a play.Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUSTROILUSCall here my varlet; I'll unarm again:Why should I war without the walls of Troy,That find such cruel battle here within?Each Trojan that is master of his heart,Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.PANDARUSWill this gear ne'er be mended?TROILUSThe Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;But I am weaker than a woman's tear,Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,Less valiant than the virgin in the nightAnd skilless as unpractised infancy.PANDARUSWell, I have told you enough of this: for my part,I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that willhave a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.TROILUSHave I not tarried?PANDARUSAy, the grinding; but you must tarrythe bolting.TROILUSHave I not tarried?PANDARUSAy, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.TROILUSStill have I tarried.PANDARUSAy, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, theheating of the oven and the baking; nay, you muststay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.TROILUSPatience herself, what goddess e'er she be,Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.At Priam's royal table do I sit;And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?PANDARUSWell, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I sawher look, or any woman else.TROILUSI was about to tell thee:--when my heart,As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.PANDARUSAn her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--well, go to--there were no more comparison betweenthe women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; Iwould not, as they term it, praise her: but I wouldsomebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. Iwill not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--TROILUSO Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,Reply not in how many fathoms deepThey lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am madIn Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heartHer eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,In whose comparison all whites are ink,Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizureThe cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of senseHard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given meThe knife that made it.PANDARUSI speak no more than truth.TROILUSThou dost not speak so much.PANDARUSFaith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she benot, she has the mends in her own hands.TROILUSGood Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!PANDARUSI have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on ofher and ill-thought on of you; gone between andbetween, but small thanks for my labour.TROILUSWhat, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?PANDARUSBecause she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fairas Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be asfair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what careI? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.TROILUSSay I she is not fair?PANDARUSI do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool tostay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and soI'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.TROILUSPandarus,--PANDARUSNot I.TROILUSSweet Pandarus,--PANDARUSPray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as Ifound it, and there an end.Exit PANDARUS. An alarumTROILUSPeace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,When with your blood you daily paint her thus.I cannot fight upon this argument;It is too starved a subject for my sword.But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:Between our Ilium and where she resides,Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,Ourself the merchant, and this sailing PandarOur doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.Alarum. Enter AENEASAENEASHow now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?TROILUSBecause not there: this woman's answer sorts,For womanish it is to be from thence.What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?AENEASThat Paris is returned home and hurt.TROILUSBy whom, AEneas?AENEASTroilus, by Menelaus.TROILUSLet Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.AlarumAENEASHark, what good sport is out of town to-day!TROILUSBetter at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?AENEASIn all swift haste.TROILUSCome, go we then together.ExeuntSCENE II. The Same. A street.Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDERCRESSIDAWho were those went by?ALEXANDERQueen Hecuba and Helen.CRESSIDAAnd whither go they?ALEXANDERUp to the eastern tower,Whose height commands as subject all the vale,To see the battle. Hector, whose patienceIs, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,And, like as there were husbandry in war,Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,And to the field goes he; where every flowerDid, as a prophet, weep what it foresawIn Hector's wrath.CRESSIDAWhat was his cause of anger?ALEXANDERThe noise goes, this: there is among the GreeksA lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;They call him Ajax.CRESSIDAGood; and what of him?ALEXANDERThey say he is a very man per se,And stands alone.CRESSIDASo do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.ALEXANDERThis man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of theirparticular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a maninto whom nature hath so crowded humours that hisvalour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced withdiscretion: there is no man hath a virtue that hehath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but hecarries some stain of it: he is melancholy withoutcause, and merry against the hair: he hath thejoints of every thing, but everything so out of jointthat he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.CRESSIDABut how should this man, that makesme smile, make Hector angry?ALEXANDERThey say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle andstruck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hathever since kept Hector fasting and waking.CRESSIDAWho comes here?ALEXANDERMadam, your uncle Pandarus.Enter PANDARUSCRESSIDAHector's a gallant man.ALEXANDERAs may be in the world, lady.PANDARUSWhat's that? what's that?CRESSIDAGood morrow, uncle Pandarus.PANDARUSGood morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? Whenwere you at Ilium?CRESSIDAThis morning, uncle.PANDARUSWhat were you talking of when I came? Was Hectorarmed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was notup, was she?CRESSIDAHector was gone, but Helen was not up.PANDARUSEven so: Hector was stirring early.CRESSIDAThat were we talking of, and of his anger.PANDARUSWas he angry?CRESSIDASo he says here.PANDARUSTrue, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll layabout him to-day, I can tell them that: and there'sTroilus will not come far behind him: let them takeheed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.CRESSIDAWhat, is he angry too?PANDARUSWho, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.CRESSIDAO Jupiter! there's no comparison.PANDARUSWhat, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know aman if you see him?CRESSIDAAy, if I ever saw him before and knew him.PANDARUSWell, I say Troilus is Troilus.CRESSIDAThen you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.PANDARUSNo, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.CRESSIDA'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.PANDARUSHimself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.CRESSIDASo he is.PANDARUSCondition, I had gone barefoot to India.CRESSIDAHe is not Hector.PANDARUSHimself! no, he's not himself: would a' werehimself! Well, the gods are above; time must friendor end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart werein her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.CRESSIDAExcuse me.PANDARUSHe is elder.CRESSIDAPardon me, pardon me.PANDARUSTh' other's not come to't; you shall tell me anothertale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall nothave his wit this year.CRESSIDAHe shall not need it, if he have his own.PANDARUSNor his qualities.CRESSIDANo matter.PANDARUSNor his beauty.CRESSIDA'Twould not become him; his own's better.PANDARUSYou have no judgment, niece: Helenherself swore th' other day, that Troilus, fora brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--not brown neither,--CRESSIDANo, but brown.PANDARUS'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.CRESSIDATo say the truth, true and not true.PANDARUSShe praised his complexion above Paris.CRESSIDAWhy, Paris hath colour enough.PANDARUSSo he has.CRESSIDAThen Troilus should have too much: if she praisedhim above, his complexion is higher than his; hehaving colour enough, and the other higher, is tooflaming a praise for a good complexion. I had aslief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus fora copper nose.PANDARUSI swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.CRESSIDAThen she's a merry Greek indeed.PANDARUSNay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' otherday into the compassed window,--and, you know, hehas not past three or four hairs on his chin,--CRESSIDAIndeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring hisparticulars therein to a total.PANDARUSWhy, he is very young: and yet will he, withinthree pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.CRESSIDAIs he so young a man and so old a lifter?PANDARUSBut to prove to you that Helen loves him: she cameand puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--CRESSIDAJuno have mercy! how came it cloven?PANDARUSWhy, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smilingbecomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.CRESSIDAO, he smiles valiantly.PANDARUSDoes he not?CRESSIDAO yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.PANDARUSWhy, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helenloves Troilus,--CRESSIDATroilus will stand to the proof, if you'llprove it so.PANDARUSTroilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteeman addle egg.CRESSIDAIf you love an addle egg as well as you love an idlehead, you would eat chickens i' the shell.PANDARUSI cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickledhis chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, Imust needs confess,--CRESSIDAWithout the rack.PANDARUSAnd she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.CRESSIDAAlas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.PANDARUSBut there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughedthat her eyes ran o'er.CRESSIDAWith mill-stones.PANDARUSAnd Cassandra laughed.CRESSIDABut there was more temperate fire under the pot ofher eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?PANDARUSAnd Hector laughed.CRESSIDAAt what was all this laughing?PANDARUSMarry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.CRESSIDAAn't had been a green hair, I should have laughedtoo.PANDARUSThey laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.CRESSIDAWhat was his answer?PANDARUSQuoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on yourchin, and one of them is white.CRESSIDAThis is her question.PANDARUSThat's true; make no question of that. 'Two andfifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that whitehair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.''Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck'tout, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all therest so laughed, that it passed.CRESSIDASo let it now; for it has been while going by.PANDARUSWell, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.CRESSIDASo I do.PANDARUSI'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twerea man born in April.CRESSIDAAnd I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettleagainst May.A retreat soundedPANDARUSHark! they are coming from the field: shall westand up here, and see them as they pass towardIlium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.CRESSIDAAt your pleasure.PANDARUSHere, here, here's an excellent place; here we maysee most bravely: I'll tell you them all by theirnames as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.CRESSIDASpeak not so loud.AENEAS passesPANDARUSThat's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one ofthe flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but markTroilus; you shall see anon.ANTENOR passesCRESSIDAWho's that?PANDARUSThat's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundestjudgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: ifhe see me, you shall see him nod at me.CRESSIDAWill he give you the nod?PANDARUSYou shall see.CRESSIDAIf he do, the rich shall have more.HECTOR passesPANDARUSThat's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's afellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there'sa countenance! is't not a brave man?CRESSIDAO, a brave man!PANDARUSIs a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look youwhat hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, doyou see? look you there: there's no jesting;there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:there be hacks!CRESSIDABe those with swords?PANDARUSSwords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil cometo him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one'sheart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.PARIS passesLook ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he camehurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will doHelen's heart good now, ha! Would I could seeTroilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.HELENUS passesCRESSIDAWho's that?PANDARUSThat's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That'sHelenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.CRESSIDACan Helenus fight, uncle?PANDARUSHelenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. Imarvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear thepeople cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.CRESSIDAWhat sneaking fellow comes yonder?TROILUS passesPANDARUSWhere? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! theprince of chivalry!CRESSIDAPeace, for shame, peace!PANDARUSMark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well uponhim, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, andhis helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er sawthree and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, tochange, would give an eye to boot.CRESSIDAHere come more.Forces passPANDARUSAsses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!porridge after meat! I could live and die i' theeyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eaglesare gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I hadrather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon andall Greece.CRESSIDAThere is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.PANDARUSAchilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.CRESSIDAWell, well.PANDARUS'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? haveyou any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is notbirth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?CRESSIDAAy, a minced man: and then to be baked with no datein the pie, for then the man's date's out.PANDARUSYou are such a woman! one knows not at what ward youlie.CRESSIDAUpon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, todefend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend minehonesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, todefend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at athousand watches.PANDARUSSay one of your watches.CRESSIDANay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of thechiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I wouldnot have hit, I can watch you for telling how I tookthe blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it'spast watching.PANDARUSYou are such another!Enter Troilus's BoyBoySir, my lord would instantly speak with you.PANDARUSWhere?BoyAt your own house; there he unarms him.PANDARUSGood boy, tell him I come.Exit boyI doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.CRESSIDAAdieu, uncle.PANDARUSI'll be with you, niece, by and by.CRESSIDATo bring, uncle?PANDARUSAy, a token from Troilus.CRESSIDABy the same token, you are a bawd.Exit PANDARUSWords, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,He offers in another's enterprise;But more in Troilus thousand fold I seeThan in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:That she was never yet that ever knewLove got so sweet as when desire did sue.Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.ExeuntSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and othersAGAMEMNONPrinces,What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?The ample proposition that hope makesIn all designs begun on earth belowFails in the promised largeness: cheques and disastersGrow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,Infect the sound pine and divert his grainTortive and errant from his course of growth.Nor, princes, is it matter new to usThat we come short of our suppose so farThat after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;Sith every action that hath gone before,Whereof we have record, trial did drawBias and thwart, not answering the aim,And that unbodied figure of the thoughtThat gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,And call them shames? which are indeed nought elseBut the protractive trials of great JoveTo find persistive constancy in men:The fineness of which metal is not foundIn fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,The wise and fool, the artist and unread,The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,Puffing at all, winnows the light away;And what hath mass or matter, by itselfLies rich in virtue and unmingled.NESTORWith due observance of thy godlike seat,Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall applyThy latest words. In the reproof of chanceLies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,How many shallow bauble boats dare sailUpon her patient breast, making their wayWith those of nobler bulk!But let the ruffian Boreas once enrageThe gentle Thetis, and anon beholdThe strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,Bounding between the two moist elements,Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boatWhose weak untimber'd sides but even nowCo-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,Or made a toast for Neptune. Even soDoth valour's show and valour's worth divideIn storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightnessThe herd hath more annoyance by the breezeThan by the tiger; but when the splitting windMakes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courageAs roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,And with an accent tuned in selfsame keyRetorts to chiding fortune.ULYSSESAgamemnon,Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.In whom the tempers and the minds of allShould be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.Besides the applause and approbation To which,To AGAMEMNONmost mighty for thy place and sway,To NESTORAnd thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out lifeI give to both your speeches, which were suchAs Agamemnon and the hand of GreeceShould hold up high in brass, and such againAs venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-treeOn which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish earsTo his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.AGAMEMNONSpeak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expectThat matter needless, of importless burden,Divide thy lips, than we are confident,When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,We shall hear music, wit and oracle.ULYSSESTroy, yet upon his basis, had been down,And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,But for these instances.The specialty of rule hath been neglected:And, look, how many Grecian tents do standHollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.When that the general is not like the hiveTo whom the foragers shall all repair,What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.The heavens themselves, the planets and this centreObserve degree, priority and place,Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,Office and custom, in all line of order;And therefore is the glorious planet SolIn noble eminence enthroned and spheredAmidst the other; whose medicinable eyeCorrects the ill aspects of planets evil,And posts, like the commandment of a king,Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planetsIn evil mixture to disorder wander,What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,Divert and crack, rend and deracinateThe unity and married calm of statesQuite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,Which is the ladder to all high designs,Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,The primogenitive and due of birth,Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,But by degree, stand in authentic place?Take but degree away, untune that string,And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meetsIn mere oppugnancy: the bounded watersShould lift their bosoms higher than the shoresAnd make a sop of all this solid globe:Strength should be lord of imbecility,And the rude son should strike his father dead:Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,Between whose endless jar justice resides,Should lose their names, and so should justice too.Then every thing includes itself in power,Power into will, will into appetite;And appetite, an universal wolf,So doubly seconded with will and power,Must make perforce an universal prey,And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,This chaos, when degree is suffocate,Follows the choking.And this neglection of degree it isThat by a pace goes backward, with a purposeIt hath to climb. The general's disdain'dBy him one step below, he by the next,That next by him beneath; so every step,Exampled by the first pace that is sickOf his superior, grows to an envious feverOf pale and bloodless emulation:And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.NESTORMost wisely hath Ulysses here discover'dThe fever whereof all our power is sick.AGAMEMNONThe nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,What is the remedy?ULYSSESThe great Achilles, whom opinion crownsThe sinew and the forehand of our host,Having his ear full of his airy fame,Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tentLies mocking our designs: with him PatroclusUpon a lazy bed the livelong dayBreaks scurril jests;And with ridiculous and awkward action,Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,Thy topless deputation he puts on,And, like a strutting player, whose conceitLies in his hamstring, and doth think it richTo hear the wooden dialogue and sound'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seemingHe acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'dWould seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuffThe large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,As he being drest to some oration.'That's done, as near as the extremest endsOf parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,Arming to answer in a night alarm.'And then, forsooth, the faint defects of ageMust be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sportSir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split allIn pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,Severals and generals of grace exact,Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,Success or loss, what is or is not, servesAs stuff for these two to make paradoxes.NESTORAnd in the imitation of these twain--Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crownsWith an imperial voice--many are infect.Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his headIn such a rein, in full as proud a placeAs broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,To match us in comparisons with dirt,To weaken and discredit our exposure,How rank soever rounded in with danger.ULYSSESThey tax our policy, and call it cowardice,Count wisdom as no member of the war,Forestall prescience, and esteem no actBut that of hand: the still and mental parts,That do contrive how many hands shall strike,When fitness calls them on, and know by measureOf their observant toil the enemies' weight,--Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;So that the ram that batters down the wall,For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,They place before his hand that made the engine,Or those that with the fineness of their soulsBy reason guide his execution.NESTORLet this be granted, and Achilles' horseMakes many Thetis' sons.A tucketAGAMEMNONWhat trumpet? look, Menelaus.MENELAUSFrom Troy.Enter AENEASAGAMEMNONWhat would you 'fore our tent?AENEASIs this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?AGAMEMNONEven this.AENEASMay one, that is a herald and a prince,Do a fair message to his kingly ears?AGAMEMNONWith surety stronger than Achilles' arm'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voiceCall Agamemnon head and general.AENEASFair leave and large security. How mayA stranger to those most imperial looksKnow them from eyes of other mortals?AGAMEMNONHow!AENEASAy;I ask, that I might waken reverence,And bid the cheek be ready with a blushModest as morning when she coldly eyesThe youthful Phoebus:Which is that god in office, guiding men?Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?AGAMEMNONThis Trojan scorns us; or the men of TroyAre ceremonious courtiers.AENEASCourtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,Jove's accord,Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!The worthiness of praise distains his worth,If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:But what the repining enemy commends,That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,transcends.AGAMEMNONSir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?AENEASAy, Greek, that is my name.AGAMEMNONWhat's your affair I pray you?AENEASSir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.AGAMEMNONHe hears naught privately that comes from Troy.AENEASNor I from Troy come not to whisper him:I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,To set his sense on the attentive bent,And then to speak.AGAMEMNONSpeak frankly as the wind;It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,He tells thee so himself.AENEASTrumpet, blow loud,Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;And every Greek of mettle, let him know,What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.Trumpet soundsWe have, great Agamemnon, here in TroyA prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--Who in this dull and long-continued truceIs rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!If there be one among the fair'st of GreeceThat holds his honour higher than his ease,That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,That loves his mistress more than in confession,With truant vows to her own lips he loves,And dare avow her beauty and her worthIn other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,And will to-morrow with his trumpet callMidway between your tents and walls of Troy,To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:If any come, Hector shall honour him;If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worthThe splinter of a lance. Even so much.AGAMEMNONThis shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;If none of them have soul in such a kind,We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,That means not, hath not, or is not in love!If then one is, or hath, or means to be,That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.NESTORTell him of Nestor, one that was a manWhen Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;But if there be not in our Grecian hostOne noble man that hath one spark of fire,To answer for his love, tell him from meI'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaverAnd in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,And meeting him will tell him that my ladyWas fairer than his grandam and as chasteAs may be in the world: his youth in flood,I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.AENEASNow heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!ULYSSESAmen.AGAMEMNONFair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.Achilles shall have word of this intent;So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:Yourself shall feast with us before you goAnd find the welcome of a noble foe.Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTORULYSSESNestor!NESTORWhat says Ulysses?ULYSSESI have a young conception in my brain;Be you my time to bring it to some shape.NESTORWhat is't?ULYSSESThis 'tis:Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded prideThat hath to this maturity blown upIn rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,To overbulk us all.NESTORWell, and how?ULYSSESThis challenge that the gallant Hector sends,However it is spread in general name,Relates in purpose only to Achilles.NESTORThe purpose is perspicuous even as substance,Whose grossness little characters sum up:And, in the publication, make no strain,But that Achilles, were his brain as barrenAs banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purposePointing on him.ULYSSESAnd wake him to the answer, think you?NESTORYes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,That can from Hector bring his honour off,If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;For here the Trojans taste our dear'st reputeWith their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,Our imputation shall be oddly poisedIn this wild action; for the success,Although particular, shall give a scantlingOf good or bad unto the general;And in such indexes, although small pricksTo their subsequent volumes, there is seenThe baby figure of the giant massOf things to come at large. It is supposedHe that meets Hector issues from our choiceAnd choice, being mutual act of all our souls,Makes merit her election, and doth boil,As 'twere from us all, a man distill'dOut of our virtues; who miscarrying,What heart receives from hence the conquering part,To steel a strong opinion to themselves?Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,In no less working than are swords and bowsDirective by the limbs.ULYSSESGive pardon to my speech:Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,The lustre of the better yet to show,Shall show the better. Do not consentThat ever Hector and Achilles meet;For both our honour and our shame in thisAre dogg'd with two strange followers.NESTORI see them not with my old eyes: what are they?ULYSSESWhat glory our Achilles shares from Hector,Were he not proud, we all should share with him:But he already is too insolent;A nd we were better parch in Afric sunThan in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,Why then, we did our main opinion crushIn taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;And, by device, let blockish Ajax drawThe sort to fight with Hector: among ourselvesGive him allowance for the better man;For that will physic the great MyrmidonWho broils in loud applause, and make him fallHis crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,Yet go we under our opinion stillThat we have better men. But, hit or miss,Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.NESTORUlysses,Now I begin to relish thy advice;And I will give a taste of it forthwithTo Agamemnon: go we to him straight.Two curs shall tame each other: pride aloneMust tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.ExeuntACT IISCENE I.

How now,Thersites! what's the matter, man?THERSITESYou see him there, do you?ACHILLESAy; what's the matter?THERSITESNay, look upon him.ACHILLESSo I do: what's the matter?THERSITESNay, but regard him well.ACHILLES'Well!' why, I do so.THERSITESBut yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever youtake him to be, he is Ajax.ACHILLESI know that, fool.THERSITESAy, but that fool knows not himself.AJAXTherefore I beat thee.THERSITESLo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! hisevasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed hisbrain more than he has beat my bones: I will buynine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is notworth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly andhis guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say ofhim.ACHILLESWhat?THERSITESI say, this Ajax--Ajax offers to beat himACHILLESNay, good Ajax.THERSITESHas not so much wit--ACHILLESNay, I must hold you.THERSITESAs will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom hecomes to fight.ACHILLESPeace, fool!THERSITESI would have peace and quietness, but the fool willnot: he there: that he: look you there.AJAXO thou damned cur!

Farewell.AJAXFarewell. Who shall answer him?ACHILLESI know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwiseHe knew his man.AJAXO, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.ExeuntSCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUSPRIAMAfter so many hours, lives, speeches spent,Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumedIn hot digestion of this cormorant war--Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?HECTORThough no man lesser fears the Greeks than IAs far as toucheth my particular,Yet, dread Priam,There is no lady of more softer bowels,More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'dThe beacon of the wise, the tent that searchesTo the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:Since the first sword was drawn about this question,Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:If we have lost so many tenths of ours,To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,Had it our name, the value of one ten,What merit's in that reason which deniesThe yielding of her up?TROILUSFie, fie, my brother!Weigh you the worth and honour of a kingSo great as our dread father in a scaleOf common ounces? will you with counters sumThe past proportion of his infinite?And buckle in a waist most fathomlessWith spans and inches so diminutiveAs fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!HELENUSNo marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,You are so empty of them. Should not our fatherBear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,Because your speech hath none that tells him so?TROILUSYou are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;You fur your gloves with reason. Here areyour reasons:You know an enemy intends you harm;You know a sword employ'd is perilous,And reason flies the object of all harm:Who marvels then, when Helenus beholdsA Grecian and his sword, if he do setThe very wings of reason to his heelsAnd fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honourShould have hare-hearts, would they but fattheir thoughtsWith this cramm'd reason: reason and respectMake livers pale and lustihood deject.HECTORBrother, she is not worth what she doth costThe holding.TROILUSWhat is aught, but as 'tis valued?HECTORBut value dwells not in particular will;It holds his estimate and dignityAs well wherein 'tis precious of itselfAs in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatryTo make the service greater than the godAnd the will dotes that is attributiveTo what infectiously itself affects,Without some image of the affected merit.TROILUSI take to-day a wife, and my electionIs led on in the conduct of my will;My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shoresOf will and judgment: how may I avoid,Although my will distaste what it elected,The wife I chose? there can be no evasionTo blench from this and to stand firm by honour:We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viandsWe do not throw in unrespective sieve,Because we now are full. It was thought meetParis should do some vengeance on the Greeks:Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truceAnd did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshnessWrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your handsAnd cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you nowThe issue of your proper wisdoms rate,And do a deed that fortune never did,Beggar the estimation which you prizedRicher than sea and land? O, theft most base,That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,That in their country did them that disgrace,We fear to warrant in our native place!CASSANDRA[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!PRIAMWhat noise? what shriek is this?TROILUS'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.CASSANDRA[Within]  Cry, Trojans!HECTORIt is Cassandra.Enter CASSANDRA, ravingCASSANDRACry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,And I will fill them with prophetic tears.HECTORPeace, sister, peace!CASSANDRAVirgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,Add to my clamours! let us pay betimesA moiety of that mass of moan to come.Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.ExitHECTORNow, youthful Troilus, do not these high strainsOf divination in our sister workSome touches of remorse? or is your bloodSo madly hot that no discourse of reason,Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,Can qualify the same?TROILUSWhy, brother Hector,We may not think the justness of each actSuch and no other than event doth form it,Nor once deject the courage of our minds,Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick rapturesCannot distaste the goodness of a quarrelWhich hath our several honours all engagedTo make it gracious. For my private part,I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:And Jove forbid there should be done amongst usSuch things as might offend the weakest spleenTo fight for and maintain!PARISElse might the world convince of levityAs well my undertakings as your counsels:But I attest the gods, your full consentGave wings to my propension and cut offAll fears attending on so dire a project.For what, alas, can these my single arms?What Propugnation is in one man's valour,To stand the push and enmity of thoseThis quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,Were I alone to pass the difficultiesAnd had as ample power as I have will,Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,Nor faint in the pursuit.PRIAMParis, you speakLike one besotted on your sweet delights:You have the honey still, but these the gall;So to be valiant is no praise at all.PARISSir, I propose not merely to myselfThe pleasures such a beauty brings with it;But I would have the soil of her fair rapeWiped off, in honourable keeping her.What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,Now to deliver her possession upOn terms of base compulsion! Can it beThat so degenerate a strain as thisShould once set footing in your generous bosoms?There's not the meanest spirit on our partyWithout a heart to dare or sword to drawWhen Helen is defended, nor none so nobleWhose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamedWhere Helen is the subject; then, I say,Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,The world's large spaces cannot parallel.HECTORParis and Troilus, you have both said well,And on the cause and question now in handHave glozed, but superficially: not muchUnlike young men, whom Aristotle thoughtUnfit to hear moral philosophy:The reasons you allege do more conduceTo the hot passion of distemper'd bloodThan to make up a free determination'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revengeHave ears more deaf than adders to the voiceOf any true decision. Nature cravesAll dues be render'd to their owners: now,What nearer debt in all humanityThan wife is to the husband? If this lawOf nature be corrupted through affection,And that great minds, of partial indulgenceTo their benumbed wills, resist the same,There is a law in each well-order'd nationTo curb those raging appetites that areMost disobedient and refractory.If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,As it is known she is, these moral lawsOf nature and of nations speak aloudTo have her back return'd: thus to persistIn doing wrong extenuates not wrong,But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinionIs this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,My spritely brethren, I propend to youIn resolution to keep Helen still,For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependanceUpon our joint and several dignities.TROILUSWhy, there you touch'd the life of our design:Were it not glory that we more affectedThan the performance of our heaving spleens,I would not wish a drop of Trojan bloodSpent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,She is a theme of honour and renown,A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,Whose present courage may beat down our foes,And fame in time to come canonize us;For, I presume, brave Hector would not loseSo rich advantage of a promised gloryAs smiles upon the forehead of this actionFor the wide world's revenue.HECTORI am yours,You valiant offspring of great Priamus.I have a roisting challenge sent amongstThe dun and factious nobles of the GreeksWill strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:I was advertised their great general slept,Whilst emulation in the army crept:This, I presume, will wake him.ExeuntSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.Enter THERSITES, solusTHERSITESHow now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth ofthy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? Hebeats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn toconjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue ofmy spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, arare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these twoundermine it, the walls will stand till they fall ofthemselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thycaduceus, if ye take not that little, little lessthan little wit from them that they have! whichshort-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundantscarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a flyfrom a spider, without drawing their massy irons andcutting the web. After this, the vengeance on thewhole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,methinks, is the curse dependent on those that warfor a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envysay Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!Enter PATROCLUSPATROCLUSWho's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.THERSITESIf I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thouwouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: butit is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The commoncurse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine ingreat revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, anddiscipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thydirection till thy death! then if she that lays theeout says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn andsworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.Amen. Where's Achilles?PATROCLUSWhat, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?THERSITESAy: the heavens hear me!Enter ACHILLESACHILLESWho's there?PATROCLUSThersites, my lord.ACHILLESWhere, where?

Then tell me, Patroclus,what's Achilles?PATROCLUSThy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,what's thyself?THERSITESThy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,what art thou?PATROCLUSThou mayst tell that knowest.ACHILLESO, tell, tell.THERSITESI'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commandsAchilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'knower, and Patroclus is a fool.PATROCLUSYou rascal!THERSITESPeace, fool! I have not done.ACHILLESHe is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.THERSITESAgamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersitesis a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.ACHILLESDerive this; come.THERSITESAgamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, andPatroclus is a fool positive.PATROCLUSWhy am I a fool?THERSITESMake that demand of the prover. It suffices me thouart. Look you, who comes here?ACHILLESPatroclus, I'll speak with nobody.Come in with me, Thersites.ExitTHERSITESHere is such patchery, such juggling and suchknavery! all the argument is a cuckold and awhore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factionsand bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo onthe subject! and war and lechery confound all!ExitEnter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAXAGAMEMNONWhere is Achilles?PATROCLUSWithin his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.AGAMEMNONLet it be known to him that we are here.He shent our messengers; and we lay byOur appertainments, visiting of him:Let him be told so; lest perchance he thinkWe dare not move the question of our place,Or know not what we are.PATROCLUSI shall say so to him.ExitULYSSESWe saw him at the opening of his tent:He is not sick.AJAXYes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call itmelancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by myhead, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us thecause. A word, my lord.Takes AGAMEMNON asideNESTORWhat moves Ajax thus to bay at him?ULYSSESAchilles hath inveigled his fool from him.NESTORWho, Thersites?ULYSSESHe.NESTORThen will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.ULYSSESNo, you see, he is his argument that has hisargument, Achilles.NESTORAll the better; their fraction is more our wish thantheir faction: but it was a strong composure a foolcould disunite.ULYSSESThe amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easilyuntie. Here comes Patroclus.Re-enter PATROCLUSNESTORNo Achilles with him.ULYSSESThe elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.PATROCLUSAchilles bids me say, he is much sorry,If any thing more than your sport and pleasureDid move your greatness and this noble stateTo call upon him; he hopes it is no otherBut for your health and your digestion sake,And after-dinner's breath.AGAMEMNONHear you, Patroclus:We are too well acquainted with these answers:But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,Cannot outfly our apprehensions.Much attribute he hath, and much the reasonWhy we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,Not virtuously on his own part beheld,Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,If you do say we think him over-proudAnd under-honest, in self-assumption greaterThan in the note of judgment; and worthierthan himselfHere tend the savage strangeness he puts on,Disguise the holy strength of their command,And underwrite in an observing kindHis humorous predominance; yea, watchHis pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as ifThe passage and whole carriage of this actionRode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,That if he overhold his price so much,We'll none of him; but let him, like an engineNot portable, lie under this report:'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:A stirring dwarf we do allowance giveBefore a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.PATROCLUSI shall; and bring his answer presently.ExitAGAMEMNONIn second voice we'll not be satisfied;We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.Exit ULYSSESAJAXWhat is he more than another?AGAMEMNONNo more than what he thinks he is.AJAXIs he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself abetter man than I am?AGAMEMNONNo question.AJAXWill you subscribe his thought, and say he is?AGAMEMNONNo, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, aswise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogethermore tractable.AJAXWhy should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? Iknow not what pride is.AGAMEMNONYour mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues thefairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride ishis own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devoursthe deed in the praise.AJAXI do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.NESTORYet he loves himself: is't not strange?AsideRe-enter ULYSSESULYSSESAchilles will not to the field to-morrow.AGAMEMNONWhat's his excuse?ULYSSESHe doth rely on none,But carries on the stream of his disposeWithout observance or respect of any,In will peculiar and in self-admission.AGAMEMNONWhy will he not upon our fair requestUntent his person and share the air with us?ULYSSESThings small as nothing, for request's sake only,He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,And speaks not to himself but with a prideThat quarrels at self-breath: imagined worthHolds in his blood such swoln and hot discourseThat 'twixt his mental and his active partsKingdom'd Achilles in commotion ragesAnd batters down himself: what should I say?He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of itCry 'No recovery.'AGAMEMNONLet Ajax go to him.Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:'Tis said he holds you well, and will be ledAt your request a little from himself.ULYSSESO Agamemnon, let it not be so!We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makesWhen they go from Achilles: shall the proud lordThat bastes his arrogance with his own seamAnd never suffers matter of the worldEnter his thoughts, save such as do revolveAnd ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'dOf that we hold an idol more than he?No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lordMust not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,As amply titled as Achilles is,By going to Achilles:That were to enlard his fat already prideAnd add more coals to Cancer when he burnsWith entertaining great Hyperion.This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'NESTOR[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well; he rubs thevein of him.DIOMEDES[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks upthis applause!AJAXIf I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.AGAMEMNONO, no, you shall not go.AJAXAn a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:Let me go to him.ULYSSESNot for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.AJAXA paltry, insolent fellow!NESTORHow he describes himself!AJAXCan he not be sociable?ULYSSESThe raven chides blackness.AJAXI'll let his humours blood.AGAMEMNONHe will be the physician that should be the patient.AJAXAn all men were o' my mind,--ULYSSESWit would be out of fashion.AJAXA' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:shall pride carry it?NESTORAn 'twould, you'ld carry half.ULYSSESA' would have ten shares.AJAXI will knead him; I'll make him supple.NESTORHe's not yet through warm: force him with praises:pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.ULYSSES[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.NESTOROur noble general, do not do so.DIOMEDESYou must prepare to fight without Achilles.ULYSSESWhy, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;I will be silent.NESTORWherefore should you so?He is not emulous, as Achilles is.ULYSSESKnow the whole world, he is as valiant.AJAXA whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!Would he were a Trojan!NESTORWhat a vice were it in Ajax now,--ULYSSESIf he were proud,--DIOMEDESOr covetous of praise,--ULYSSESAy, or surly borne,--DIOMEDESOr strange, or self-affected!ULYSSESThank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of natureThrice famed, beyond all erudition:But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,Let Mars divide eternity in twain,And give him half: and, for thy vigour,Bull-bearing Milo his addition yieldTo sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confinesThy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;Instructed by the antiquary times,He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:Put pardon, father Nestor, were your daysAs green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,You should not have the eminence of him,But be as Ajax.AJAXShall I call you father?NESTORAy, my good son.DIOMEDESBe ruled by him, Lord Ajax.ULYSSESThere is no tarrying here; the hart AchillesKeeps thicket. Please it our great generalTo call together all his state of war;Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrowWe must with all our main of power stand fast:And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.AGAMEMNONGo we to council. Let Achilles sleep:Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.ExeuntACT IIISCENE I. Troy.

The same. Pandarus' orchard.Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meetingPANDARUSHow now! where's thy master? at my cousinCressida's?BoyNo, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.PANDARUSO, here he comes.Enter TROILUSHow now, how now!TROILUSSirrah, walk off.Exit BoyPANDARUSHave you seen my cousin?TROILUSNo, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banksStaying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,And give me swift transportance to those fieldsWhere I may wallow in the lily-bedsProposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wingsAnd fly with me to Cressid!PANDARUSWalk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.ExitTROILUSI am giddy; expectation whirls me round.The imaginary relish is so sweetThat it enchants my sense: what will it be,When that the watery palate tastes indeedLove's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,For the capacity of my ruder powers:I fear it much; and I do fear besides,That I shall lose distinction in my joys;As doth a battle, when they charge on heapsThe enemy flying.Re-enter PANDARUSPANDARUSShe's making her ready, she'll come straight: youmust be witty now. She does so blush, and fetchesher wind so short, as if she were frayed with asprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiestvillain: she fetches her breath as short as anew-ta'en sparrow.ExitTROILUSEven such a passion doth embrace my bosom:My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;And all my powers do their bestowing lose,Like vassalage at unawares encounteringThe eye of majesty.Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDAPANDARUSCome, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her thatyou have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak toher? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see yourpicture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offenddaylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the airis sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ereI part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all theducks i' the river: go to, go to.TROILUSYou have bereft me of all words, lady.PANDARUSWords pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'llbereave you o' the deeds too, if she call youractivity in question. What, billing again? Here's'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.ExitCRESSIDAWill you walk in, my lord?TROILUSO Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!CRESSIDAWished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!TROILUSWhat should they grant? what makes this prettyabruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweetlady in the fountain of our love?CRESSIDAMore dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.TROILUSFears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.CRESSIDABlind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds saferfooting than blind reason stumbling without fear: tofear the worst oft cures the worse.TROILUSO, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid'spageant there is presented no monster.CRESSIDANor nothing monstrous neither?TROILUSNothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weepseas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinkingit harder for our mistress to devise impositionenough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the willis infinite and the execution confined, that thedesire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.CRESSIDAThey say all lovers swear more performance than theyare able and yet reserve an ability that they neverperform, vowing more than the perfection of ten anddischarging less than the tenth part of one. Theythat have the voice of lions and the act of hares,are they not monsters?TROILUSAre there such? such are not we: praise us as weare tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall gobare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversionshall have a praise in present: we will not namedesert before his birth, and, being born, his additionshall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilusshall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worstshall be a mock for his truth, and what truth canspeak truest not truer than Troilus.CRESSIDAWill you walk in, my lord?Re-enter PANDARUSPANDARUSWhat, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?CRESSIDAWell, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.PANDARUSI thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if heflinch, chide me for it.TROILUSYou know now your hostages; your uncle's word and myfirm faith.PANDARUSNay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,though they be long ere they are wooed, they areconstant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;they'll stick where they are thrown.CRESSIDABoldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and dayFor many weary months.TROILUSWhy was my Cressid then so hard to win?CRESSIDAHard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,With the first glance that ever--pardon me--If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.I love you now; but not, till now, so muchBut I might master it: in faith, I lie;My thoughts were like unbridled children, grownToo headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,When we are so unsecret to ourselves?But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,Or that we women had men's privilegeOf speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,For in this rapture I shall surely speakThe thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness drawsMy very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.TROILUSAnd shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.PANDARUSPretty, i' faith.CRESSIDAMy lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?For this time will I take my leave, my lord.TROILUSYour leave, sweet Cressid!PANDARUSLeave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--CRESSIDAPray you, content you.TROILUSWhat offends you, lady?CRESSIDASir, mine own company.TROILUSYou cannot shun Yourself.CRESSIDALet me go and try:I have a kind of self resides with you;But an unkind self, that itself will leave,To be another's fool. I would be gone:Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.TROILUSWell know they what they speak that speak so wisely.CRESSIDAPerchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;And fell so roundly to a large confession,To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,Or else you love not, for to be wise and loveExceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.TROILUSO that I thought it could be in a woman--As, if it can, I will presume in you--To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;To keep her constancy in plight and youth,Outliving beauty's outward, with a mindThat doth renew swifter than blood decays!Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,That my integrity and truth to youMight be affronted with the match and weightOf such a winnow'd purity in love;How were I then uplifted! but, alas!I am as true as truth's simplicityAnd simpler than the infancy of truth.CRESSIDAIn that I'll war with you.TROILUSO virtuous fight,When right with right wars who shall be most right!True swains in love shall in the world to comeApprove their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,Full of protest, of oath and big compare,Want similes, truth tired with iteration,As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,Yet, after all comparisons of truth,As truth's authentic author to be cited,'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,And sanctify the numbers.CRESSIDAProphet may you be!If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,When time is old and hath forgot itself,When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,And mighty states characterless are gratedTo dusty nothing, yet let memory,From false to false, among false maids in love,Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as falseAs air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,''Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,'As false as Cressid.'PANDARUSGo to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be thewitness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.If ever you prove false one to another, since I havetaken such pains to bring you together, let allpitiful goers-between be called to the world's endafter my name; call them all Pandars; let allconstant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.TROILUSAmen.CRESSIDAAmen.PANDARUSAmen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with abed; which bed, because it shall not speak of yourpretty encounters, press it to death: away!And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens hereBed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!ExeuntSCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHASCALCHASNow, princes, for the service I have done you,The advantage of the time prompts me aloudTo call for recompense. Appear it to your mindThat, through the sight I bear in things to love,I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,From certain and possess'd conveniences,To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me allThat time, acquaintance, custom and conditionMade tame and most familiar to my nature,And here, to do you service, am becomeAs new into the world, strange, unacquainted:I do beseech you, as in way of taste,To give me now a little benefit,Out of those many register'd in promise,Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.AGAMEMNONWhat wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.CALCHASYou have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,I know, is such a wrest in their affairsThat their negotiations all must slack,Wanting his manage; and they will almostGive us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,And he shall buy my daughter; and her presenceShall quite strike off all service I have done,In most accepted pain.AGAMEMNONLet Diomedes bear him,And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall haveWhat he requests of us. Good Diomed,Furnish you fairly for this interchange:Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrowBe answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.DIOMEDESThis shall I undertake; and 'tis a burdenWhich I am proud to bear.Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHASEnter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tentULYSSESAchilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:Please it our general to pass strangely by him,As if he were forgot; and, princes all,Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question meWhy such unplausive eyes are bent on him:If so, I have derision medicinable,To use between your strangeness and his pride,Which his own will shall have desire to drink:It may be good: pride hath no other glassTo show itself but pride, for supple kneesFeed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.AGAMEMNONWe'll execute your purpose, and put onA form of strangeness as we pass along:So do each lord, and either greet him not,Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him moreThan if not look'd on. I will lead the way.ACHILLESWhat, comes the general to speak with me?You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.AGAMEMNONWhat says Achilles? would he aught with us?NESTORWould you, my lord, aught with the general?ACHILLESNo.NESTORNothing, my lord.AGAMEMNONThe better.Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTORACHILLESGood day, good day.MENELAUSHow do you? how do you?ExitACHILLESWhat, does the cuckold scorn me?AJAXHow now, Patroclus!ACHILLESGood morrow, Ajax.AJAXHa?ACHILLESGood morrow.AJAXAy, and good next day too.ExitACHILLESWhat mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?PATROCLUSThey pass by strangely: they were used to bendTo send their smiles before them to Achilles;To come as humbly as they used to creepTo holy altars.ACHILLESWhat, am I poor of late?'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,Must fall out with men too: what the declined isHe shall as soon read in the eyes of othersAs feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,And not a man, for being simply man,Hath any honour, but honour for those honoursThat are without him, as place, riches, favour,Prizes of accident as oft as merit:Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,Do one pluck down another and togetherDie in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoyAt ample point all that I did possess,Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find outSomething not worth in me such rich beholdingAs they have often given. Here is Ulysses;I'll interrupt his reading.How now Ulysses!ULYSSESNow, great Thetis' son!ACHILLESWhat are you reading?ULYSSESA strange fellow hereWrites me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,How much in having, or without or in,Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;As when his virtues shining upon othersHeat them and they retort that heat againTo the first giver.'ACHILLESThis is not strange, Ulysses.The beauty that is borne here in the faceThe bearer knows not, but commends itselfTo others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposedSalutes each other with each other's form;For speculation turns not to itself,Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd thereWhere it may see itself. This is not strange at all.ULYSSESI do not strain at the position,--It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;Who, in his circumstance, expressly provesThat no man is the lord of any thing,Though in and of him there be much consisting,Till he communicate his parts to others:Nor doth he of himself know them for aughtTill he behold them form'd in the applauseWhere they're extended; who, like an arch,reverberatesThe voice again, or, like a gate of steelFronting the sun, receives and renders backHis figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;And apprehended here immediatelyThe unknown Ajax.Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there areMost abject in regard and dear in use!What things again most dear in the esteemAnd poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--An act that very chance doth throw upon him--Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,While some men leave to do!How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!How one man eats into another's pride,While pride is fasting in his wantonness!To see these Grecian lords!--why, even alreadyThey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,As if his foot were on brave Hector's breastAnd great Troy shrieking.ACHILLESI do believe it; for they pass'd by meAs misers do by beggars, neither gave to meGood word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?ULYSSESTime hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'dAs fast as they are made, forgot as soonAs done: perseverance, dear my lord,Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hangQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mailIn monumental mockery. Take the instant way;For honour travels in a strait so narrow,Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;For emulation hath a thousand sonsThat one by one pursue: if you give way,Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush byAnd leave you hindmost;Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;For time is like a fashionable hostThat slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,And farewell goes out sighing. O, let notvirtue seekRemuneration for the thing it was;For beauty, wit,High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,Love, friendship, charity, are subjects allTo envious and calumniating time.One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,Though they are made and moulded of things past,And give to dust that is a little giltMore laud than gilt o'er-dusted.The present eye praises the present object.Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;Since things in motion sooner catch the eyeThan what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,And still it might, and yet it may again,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself aliveAnd case thy reputation in thy tent;Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselvesAnd drave great Mars to faction.ACHILLESOf this my privacyI have strong reasons.ULYSSESBut 'gainst your privacyThe reasons are more potent and heroical:'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in loveWith one of Priam's daughters.ACHILLESHa! known!ULYSSESIs that a wonder?The providence that's in a watchful stateKnows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.There is a mystery--with whom relationDurst never meddle--in the soul of state;Which hath an operation more divineThan breath or pen can give expressure to:All the commerce that you have had with TroyAs perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;And better would it fit Achilles muchTo throw down Hector than Polyxena:But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.ExitPATROCLUSTo this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:A woman impudent and mannish grownIs not more loathed than an effeminate manIn time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;They think my little stomach to the warAnd your great love to me restrains you thus:Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton CupidShall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,Be shook to air.ACHILLESShall Ajax fight with Hector?PATROCLUSAy, and perhaps receive much honour by him.ACHILLESI see my reputation is at stakeMy fame is shrewdly gored.PATROCLUSO, then, beware;Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:Omission to do what is necessarySeals a commission to a blank of danger;And danger, like an ague, subtly taintsEven then when we sit idly in the sun.ACHILLESGo call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire himTo invite the Trojan lords after the combatTo see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,An appetite that I am sick withal,To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,To talk with him and to behold his visage,Even to my full of view.Enter THERSITESA labour saved!THERSITESA wonder!ACHILLESWhat?THERSITESAjax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.ACHILLESHow so?THERSITESHe must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is soprophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that heraves in saying nothing.ACHILLESHow can that be?THERSITESWhy, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a strideand a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath noarithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:bites his lip with a politic regard, as who shouldsay 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as firein a flint, which will not show without knocking.The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not hisneck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself invain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What thinkyou of this man that takes me for the general? He'sgrown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on bothsides, like a leather jerkin.ACHILLESThou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.THERSITESWho, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes notanswering: speaking is for beggars; he wears histongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: letPatroclus make demands to me, you shall see thepageant of Ajax.ACHILLESTo him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire thevaliant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hectorto come unarmed to my tent, and to procuresafe-conduct for his person of the magnanimousand most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honouredcaptain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,et cetera. Do this.PATROCLUSJove bless great Ajax!THERSITESHum!PATROCLUSI come from the worthy Achilles,--THERSITESHa!PATROCLUSWho most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--THERSITESHum!PATROCLUSAnd to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.THERSITESAgamemnon!PATROCLUSAy, my lord.THERSITESHa!PATROCLUSWhat say you to't?THERSITESGod b' wi' you, with all my heart.PATROCLUSYour answer, sir.THERSITESIf to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it willgo one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for meere he has me.PATROCLUSYour answer, sir.THERSITESFare you well, with all my heart.ACHILLESWhy, but he is not in this tune, is he?THERSITESNo, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be inhim when Hector has knocked out his brains, I knownot; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apolloget his sinews to make catlings on.ACHILLESCome, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.THERSITESLet me bear another to his horse; for that's the morecapable creature.ACHILLESMy mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;And I myself see not the bottom of it.Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUSTHERSITESWould the fountain of your mind were clear again,that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be atick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.ExitACT IVSCENE I. Troy. A street.Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a  torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, and others, with torchesPARISSee, ho! who is that there?DEIPHOBUSIt is the Lord AEneas.AENEASIs the prince there in person?Had I so good occasion to lie longAs you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly businessShould rob my bed-mate of my company.DIOMEDESThat's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.PARISA valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--Witness the process of your speech, whereinYou told how Diomed, a whole week by days,Did haunt you in the field.AENEASHealth to you, valiant sir,During all question of the gentle truce;But when I meet you arm'd, as black defianceAs heart can think or courage execute.DIOMEDESThe one and other Diomed embraces.Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!But when contention and occasion meet,By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy lifeWith all my force, pursuit and policy.AENEASAnd thou shalt hunt a lion, that will flyWith his face backward. In humane gentleness,Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,No man alive can love in such a sortThe thing he means to kill more excellently.DIOMEDESWe sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,If to my sword his fate be not the glory,A thousand complete courses of the sun!But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!AENEASWe know each other well.DIOMEDESWe do; and long to know each other worse.PARISThis is the most despiteful gentle greeting,The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.What business, lord, so early?AENEASI was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.PARISHis purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this GreekTo Calchas' house, and there to render him,For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:Let's have your company, or, if you please,Haste there before us: I constantly do think--Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:Rouse him and give him note of our approach.With the whole quality wherefore: I fearWe shall be much unwelcome.AENEASThat I assure you:Troilus had rather Troy were borne to GreeceThan Cressid borne from Troy.PARISThere is no help;The bitter disposition of the timeWill have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.AENEASGood morrow, all.Exit with ServantPARISAnd tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,Myself or Menelaus?DIOMEDESBoth alike:He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,Not making any scruple of her soilure,With such a hell of pain and world of charge,And you as well to keep her, that defend her,Not palating the taste of her dishonour,With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:He, like a puling cuckold, would drink upThe lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;You, like a lecher, out of whorish loinsAre pleased to breed out your inheritors:Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;But he as he, the heavier for a whore.PARISYou are too bitter to your countrywoman.DIOMEDESShe's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:For every false drop in her bawdy veinsA Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scrupleOf her contaminated carrion weight,A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,She hath not given so many good words breathAs for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.PARISFair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:But we in silence hold this virtue well,We'll but commend what we intend to sell.Here lies our way.ExeuntSCENE II.

I might have still held off,And then you would have tarried. Hark!there's one up.PANDARUS[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?TROILUSIt is your uncle.CRESSIDAA pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:I shall have such a life!Enter PANDARUSPANDARUSHow now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, youmaid! where's my cousin Cressid?CRESSIDAGo hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.PANDARUSTo do what? to do what? let her saywhat: what have I brought you to do?CRESSIDACome, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,Nor suffer others.PANDARUSHa! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughtyman, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!CRESSIDADid not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!Knocking withinWho's that at door? good uncle, go and see.My lord, come you again into my chamber:You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.TROILUSHa, ha!CRESSIDACome, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.Knocking withinHow earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:I would not for half Troy have you seen here.Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDAPANDARUSWho's there? what's the matter? will you beatdown the door? How now! what's the matter?Enter AENEASAENEASGood morrow, lord, good morrow.PANDARUSWho's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,I knew you not: what news with you so early?AENEASIs not Prince Troilus here?PANDARUSHere! what should he do here?AENEASCome, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:It doth import him much to speak with me.PANDARUSIs he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'llbe sworn: for my own part, I came in late. Whatshould he do here?AENEASWho!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrongere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to befalse to him: do not you know of him, but yet gofetch him hither; go.Re-enter TROILUSTROILUSHow now! what's the matter?AENEASMy lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,My matter is so rash: there is at handParis your brother, and Deiphobus,The Grecian Diomed, and our AntenorDeliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,We must give up to Diomedes' handThe Lady Cressida.TROILUSIs it so concluded?AENEASBy Priam and the general state of Troy:They are at hand and ready to effect it.TROILUSHow my achievements mock me!I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,We met by chance; you did not find me here.AENEASGood, good, my lord; the secrets of natureHave not more gift in taciturnity.Exeunt TROILUS and AENEASPANDARUSIs't possible? no sooner got but lost?

I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poorgentleman! A plague upon Antenor!CRESSIDAGood uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,what's the matter?PANDARUSThou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thouart changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.CRESSIDAO you immortal gods! I will not go.PANDARUSThou must.CRESSIDAI will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;I know no touch of consanguinity;No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near meAs the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,Do to this body what extremes you can;But the strong base and building of my loveIs as the very centre of the earth,Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--PANDARUSDo, do.CRESSIDATear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heartWith sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.ExeuntSCENE III. The same. Street before Pandarus' house.Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDESPARISIt is great morning, and the hour prefix'dOf her delivery to this valiant GreekComes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,Tell you the lady what she is to do,And haste her to the purpose.TROILUSWalk into her house;I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:And to his hand when I deliver her,Think it an altar, and thy brother TroilusA priest there offering to it his own heart.ExitPARISI know what 'tis to love;And would, as I shall pity, I could help!Please you walk in, my lords.ExeuntSCENE IV. The same. Pandarus' house.Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDAPANDARUSBe moderate, be moderate.CRESSIDAWhy tell you me of moderation?The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,And violenteth in a sense as strongAs that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?If I could temporize with my affection,Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,The like allayment could I give my grief.My love admits no qualifying dross;No more my grief, in such a precious loss.PANDARUSHere, here, here he comes.Enter TROILUSAh, sweet ducks!CRESSIDAO Troilus! Troilus!Embracing himPANDARUSWhat a pair of spectacles is here!Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,'--O heart, heavy heart,Why sigh'st thou without breaking?where he answers again,'Because thou canst not ease thy smartBy friendship nor by speaking.'There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast awaynothing, for we may live to have need of such averse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?TROILUSCressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,More bright in zeal than the devotion whichCold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.CRESSIDAHave the gods envy?PANDARUSAy, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.CRESSIDAAnd is it true that I must go from Troy?TROILUSA hateful truth.CRESSIDAWhat, and from Troilus too?TROILUSFrom Troy and Troilus.CRESSIDAIs it possible?TROILUSAnd suddenly; where injury of chancePuts back leave-taking, justles roughly byAll time of pause, rudely beguiles our lipsOf all rejoindure, forcibly preventsOur lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vowsEven in the birth of our own labouring breath:We two, that with so many thousand sighsDid buy each other, must poorly sell ourselvesWith the rude brevity and discharge of one.Injurious time now with a robber's hasteCrams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:As many farewells as be stars in heaven,With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,He fumbles up into a lose adieu,And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,Distasted with the salt of broken tears.AENEAS[Within]  My lord, is the lady ready?TROILUSHark! you are call'd: some say the Genius soCries 'come' to him that instantly must die.Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.PANDARUSWhere are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, ormy heart will be blown up by the root.ExitCRESSIDAI must then to the Grecians?TROILUSNo remedy.CRESSIDAA woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!When shall we see again?TROILUSHear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--CRESSIDAI true! how now! what wicked deem is this?TROILUSNay, we must use expostulation kindly,For it is parting from us:I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,For I will throw my glove to Death himself,That there's no maculation in thy heart:But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion inMy sequent protestation; be thou true,And I will see thee.CRESSIDAO, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangersAs infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.TROILUSAnd I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.CRESSIDAAnd you this glove. When shall I see you?TROILUSI will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,To give thee nightly visitation.But yet be true.CRESSIDAO heavens! 'be true' again!TROILUSHear while I speak it, love:The Grecian youths are full of quality;They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:How novelty may move, and parts with person,Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--Makes me afeard.CRESSIDAO heavens! you love me not.TROILUSDie I a villain, then!In this I do not call your faith in questionSo mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:But I can tell that in each grace of theseThere lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devilThat tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.CRESSIDADo you think I will?TROILUSNo.But something may be done that we will not:And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,Presuming on their changeful potency.AENEAS[Within]  Nay, good my lord,--TROILUSCome, kiss; and let us part.PARIS[Within]  Brother Troilus!TROILUSGood brother, come you hither;And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.CRESSIDAMy lord, will you be true?TROILUSWho, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,I with great truth catch mere simplicity;Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.Fear not my truth: the moral of my witIs 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDESWelcome, Sir Diomed! here is the ladyWhich for Antenor we deliver you:At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,And by the way possess thee what she is.Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safeAs Priam is in Ilion.DIOMEDESFair Lady Cressid,So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,Pleads your fair usage; and to DiomedYou shall be mistress, and command him wholly.TROILUSGrecian, thou dost not use me courteously,To shame the zeal of my petition to theeIn praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praisesAs thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,I'll cut thy throat.DIOMEDESO, be not moved, Prince Troilus:Let me be privileged by my place and message,To be a speaker free; when I am henceI'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worthShe shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'TROILUSCome, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,To our own selves bend we our needful talk.Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDESTrumpet withinPARISHark!

Lady, by your leave.CRESSIDAIn kissing, do you render or receive?PATROCLUSBoth take and give.CRESSIDAI'll make my match to live,The kiss you take is better than you give;Therefore no kiss.MENELAUSI'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.CRESSIDAYou're an odd man; give even or give none.MENELAUSAn odd man, lady! every man is odd.CRESSIDANo, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,That you are odd, and he is even with you.MENELAUSYou fillip me o' the head.CRESSIDANo, I'll be sworn.ULYSSESIt were no match, your nail against his horn.May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?CRESSIDAYou may.ULYSSESI do desire it.CRESSIDAWhy, beg, then.ULYSSESWhy then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,When Helen is a maid again, and his.CRESSIDAI am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.ULYSSESNever's my day, and then a kiss of you.DIOMEDESLady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.Exit with CRESSIDANESTORA woman of quick sense.ULYSSESFie, fie upon her!There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look outAt every joint and motive of her body.O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,That give accosting welcome ere it comes,And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughtsTo every ticklish reader! set them downFor sluttish spoils of opportunityAnd daughters of the game.Trumpet withinALLThe Trojans' trumpet.AGAMEMNONYonder comes the troop.Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with AttendantsAENEASHail, all you state of Greece! what shall be doneTo him that victory commands? or do you purposeA victor shall be known? will you the knightsShall to the edge of all extremityPursue each other, or shall be dividedBy any voice or order of the field?Hector bade ask.AGAMEMNONWhich way would Hector have it?AENEASHe cares not; he'll obey conditions.ACHILLES'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,A little proudly, and great deal misprizingThe knight opposed.AENEASIf not Achilles, sir,What is your name?ACHILLESIf not Achilles, nothing.AENEASTherefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:In the extremity of great and little,Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;The one almost as infinite as all,The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,And that which looks like pride is courtesy.This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seekThis blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.ACHILLESA maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.Re-enter DIOMEDESAGAMEMNONHere is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneasConsent upon the order of their fight,So be it; either to the uttermost,Or else a breath: the combatants being kinHalf stints their strife before their strokes begin.AJAX and HECTOR enter the listsULYSSESThey are opposed already.AGAMEMNONWhat Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?ULYSSESThe youngest son of Priam, a true knight,Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:His heart and hand both open and both free;For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribesTo tender objects, but he in heat of actionIs more vindicative than jealous love:They call him Troilus, and on him erectA second hope, as fairly built as Hector.Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youthEven to his inches, and with private soulDid in great Ilion thus translate him to me.Alarum.

Let me embrace thee, Ajax:By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;Hector would have them fall upon him thus:Cousin, all honour to thee!AJAXI thank thee, HectorThou art too gentle and too free a man:I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear henceA great addition earned in thy death.HECTORNot Neoptolemus so mirable,On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st OyesCries 'This is he,' could promise to himselfA thought of added honour torn from Hector.AENEASThere is expectance here from both the sides,What further you will do.HECTORWe'll answer it;The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.AJAXIf I might in entreaties find success--As seld I have the chance--I would desireMy famous cousin to our Grecian tents.DIOMEDES'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great AchillesDoth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.HECTORAEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,And signify this loving interviewTo the expecters of our Trojan part;Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;I will go eat with thee and see your knights.AJAXGreat Agamemnon comes to meet us here.HECTORThe worthiest of them tell me name by name;But for Achilles, mine own searching eyesShall find him by his large and portly size.AGAMEMNONWorthy of arms! as welcome as to oneThat would be rid of such an enemy;But that's no welcome: understand more clear,What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husksAnd formless ruin of oblivion;But in this extant moment, faith and troth,Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,Bids thee, with most divine integrity,From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.HECTORI thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.AGAMEMNON[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, noless to you.MENELAUSLet me confirm my princely brother's greeting:You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.HECTORWho must we answer?AENEASThe noble Menelaus.HECTORO, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.MENELAUSName her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.HECTORO, pardon; I offend.NESTORI have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oftLabouring for destiny make cruel wayThrough ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,Despising many forfeits and subduements,When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,Not letting it decline on the declined,That I have said to some my standers by'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.AENEAS'Tis the old Nestor.HECTORLet me embrace thee, good old chronicle,That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.NESTORI would my arms could match thee in contention,As they contend with thee in courtesy.HECTORI would they could.NESTORHa!By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.ULYSSESI wonder now how yonder city standsWhen we have here her base and pillar by us.HECTORI know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,Since first I saw yourself and DiomedIn Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.ULYSSESSir, I foretold you then what would ensue:My prophecy is but half his journey yet;For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,Must kiss their own feet.HECTORI must not believe you:There they stand yet, and modestly I think,The fall of every Phrygian stone will costA drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,And that old common arbitrator, Time,Will one day end it.ULYSSESSo to him we leave it.Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:After the general, I beseech you nextTo feast with me and see me at my tent.ACHILLESI shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,And quoted joint by joint.HECTORIs this Achilles?ACHILLESI am Achilles.HECTORStand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.ACHILLESBehold thy fill.HECTORNay, I have done already.ACHILLESThou art too brief: I will the second time,As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.HECTORO, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;But there's more in me than thou understand'st.Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?ACHILLESTell me, you heavens, in which part of his bodyShall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?That I may give the local wound a nameAnd make distinct the very breach whereoutHector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!HECTORIt would discredit the blest gods, proud man,To answer such a question: stand again:Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantlyAs to prenominate in nice conjectureWhere thou wilt hit me dead?ACHILLESI tell thee, yea.HECTORWert thou an oracle to tell me so,I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;His insolence draws folly from my lips;But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,Or may I never--AJAXDo not chafe thee, cousin:And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,Till accident or purpose bring you to't:You may have every day enough of HectorIf you have stomach; the general state, I fear,Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.HECTORI pray you, let us see you in the field:We have had pelting wars, since you refusedThe Grecians' cause.ACHILLESDost thou entreat me, Hector?To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;To-night all friends.HECTORThy hand upon that match.AGAMEMNONFirst, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;There in the full convive we: afterwards,As Hector's leisure and your bounties shallConcur together, severally entreat him.Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,That this great soldier may his welcome know.Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSESTROILUSMy Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?ULYSSESAt Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,But gives all gaze and bent of amorous viewOn the fair Cressid.TROILUSShall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,After we part from Agamemnon's tent,To bring me thither?ULYSSESYou shall command me, sir.As gentle tell me, of what honour wasThis Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover thereThat wails her absence?TROILUSO, sir, to such as boasting show their scarsA mock is due.

Hector is gone:Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:There is a word will Priam turn to stone;Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:Hector is dead; there is no more to say.Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,Let Titan rise as early as he dare,I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.Exeunt AENEAS and TrojansAs TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other side, PANDARUSPANDARUSBut hear you, hear you!TROILUSHence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shamePursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!ExitPANDARUSA goodly medicine for my aching bones!

Let me see:Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;And being once subdued in armed tail,Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.Good traders in the flesh, set this in yourpainted cloths.As many as be here of pander's hall,Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,Some two months hence my will shall here be made:It should be now, but that my fear is this,Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.Exit
